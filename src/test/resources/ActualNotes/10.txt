IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED THAT THERE WAS FRESH THROMBUS PRESENT IN THE LEFT MAIN EXTENDING INTO THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX. CATH REPORT 84 DAYS POST PROCEDURE NOTES THE FOLLOWING "... THE LAD WAS 100% OCCLUDED AS ITS OSTIUM AND BEYOND WHERE THE STENTS ARE PLACED. NO FLOW IS NOTED INTO THE LAD. THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX HAS A CLOT WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE LEFT MAIN INTO THE PROXIMAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX WITH SLUGGISH FLOW INTO THIS VESSEL AND THROUGH THE TWO OBTUSE MARGINALS." IT WAS THEREFORE FELT TO BE A STENT THROMBOSIS. PER PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE SITE, THE INVESTIGATOR FELT THAT THE PATIENT DID EXPERIENCE AN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) BUT THE LABS DRAWN AT ADMISSION WERE NORMAL BECAUSE THEY WERE EARLY IN THE INFARCT AND THE PATIENT DIED PRIOR TO ANOTHER DRAW. THEREFORE, THE PATIENT'S CARDIAC ENZYMES DID NOT MEET CRITERIA FOR AN MI, HOWEVER, THE SITE STILL WISHES TO REPORT THE MI.
