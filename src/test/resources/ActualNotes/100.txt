SAME CASE AS #2134265-2008-04988, 04990. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, A THROMBOSIS AND DEATH OCCURRED. A CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WAS PERFORMED DUE TO A POSITIVE STRESS TEST. ACCESS WAS OBTAINED THROUGH THE RIGHT RADIAL ARTERY. A HIGH GRADE 70-90% STENOSIS WAS FOUND IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) WITH SEVERE DISEASE IN THE PROXIMAL AND MID PORTIONS. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X15MM NON-BSC BALLOON. A TAXUS EXPRESS2 2.5X24MM DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE MID LAD AT 10 ATM'S FOR 28 SECONDS. NEXT, A TAXUS EXPRESS2 2.75X32MM DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE PROXIMAL LAD AT 12 ATM'S FOR 28 SECONDS. PLAQUE SHIFTED INTO THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (CX) THEREFORE, A TAXUS EXPRESS2 2.75X8MM DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE PROXIMAL CX AT 8 ATM'S FOR 19 SECONDS. EXCELLENT ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. THE STENTED PORTION OF THE VESSEL HAD 0% RESIDUAL NARROWING WITH TIMI 3 FLOW. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY ON PLAVIX FOR 6 MONTHS AND A DAILY ASPIRIN. IN 2006, A CARDIAC CATH WAS PERFORMED FOR AN ABNORMAL STRESS TEST. ALL THREE STENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE CONTINUED PATENCY WITH 0% LESIONS. IN 2007, THE PT DROVE HIMSELF TO THE ER AFTER EXPERIENCING CHEST PAIN WHILE EXERCISING. AN EKG SHOWED ST DEPRESSIONS. THE PT WAS STARTED ON ACUTE CORONARY ISCHEMIC SYNDROME PROTOCOL WHEN HE VERY RAPIDLY DETERIORATED WITH FOLLOW-UP, EKG'S SHOWING A WIDENED QRS COMPLEX AND ST SEGMENT ELEVATION. THE PT DEVELOPED VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA AND VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION AND WENT INTO CARDIO PULMONARY ARREST. THE PT WAS DEFIBRILLATED AT 200 JOULES BUT FAILED TO RESPOND. CPR WAS INITIATED AND THE PT WAS INTUBATED. HEPARIN, AMIODARONE AND ASPIRIN WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE THE PT LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. DESPITE FOLLOWING ACLS PROTOCOL AND RECEIVING ALL CONCEIVABLE HEROIC MEASURES, THE RESUSCITATION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE PT WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD. AN AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED WHICH REVEALED THAT THE TWO OVERLAPPING TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENTS IN THE LAD HAD MILD TO MODERATE NEOINTIMAL PROLIFERATION AND PERSISTENT FIBRIN AROUND THE STENT STRUTS. THE TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT IN THE CX SHOWED OCCLUSIVE PLATELET RICH THROMBUS INVOLVING PROXIMAL STENTED PORTIONS OF BOTH CX AND LAD; PERSISTENT FIBRIN AROUND STENT STRUTS AND MINIMAL TO ABSENT NEOINTIMAL PROLIFERATION (DELAYED HEALING).
