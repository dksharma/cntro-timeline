"THE PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING. THIS MALE PATIENT OF UNKNOWN AGE AND MEDICAL HISTORY DIED DUE TO A THROMBOTIC EVENT AND A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION EXPERIENCED APPROXIMATELY ONE-YEAR POST IMPLANTATION OF A CYPHER STENT. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED IN THE PROXIMAL TO MID CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. THE INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE WAS AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE IFU INDICATES THAT THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED IN PATIENTS WITH A RECENT ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THROMBUS OR POOR FLOW. DESCRIPTION OF THE VESSELS SUCH AS PERCENTAGE OF STENOSIS, TORTUOSITY, PRESENCE OF CALCIFICATION, ETC, WAS NOT REPORTED. VESSEL CLASSIFICATION WAS NOT REPORTED. THERE IS NO INFORMATION REGARDING PROCEDURAL DETAILS SUCH AS; DEBULKING OR PRE-DILATION OF LESION BEFORE STENT DEPLOYMENT, STENTING TECHNIQUE USED AND INTRA-PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS USED. A CYPHER STENT OF UNKNOWN LENGTH AND DIAMETER, UNKNOWN LOT NUMBERS AND UNKNOWN EXPIRATION DATE, WAS DEPLOYED AT UNKNOWN PRESSURE. THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE STENT WAS UNKNOWN. POST-DILATION OF THE STENT WAS NOT REPORTED. THE RESIDUAL DIAMETER STENOSIS WAS NOT REPORTED. CONFIRMATION OF COMPLETE STENT APPOSITION TO THE VESSEL WALL BY IVUS WAS NOT REPORTED. TIMI FLOW WAS NOT REPORTED. ANTIPLATELET THERAPY PRESCRIBED POST-PROCEDURE WAS NOT REPORTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. THE PRODUCT REMAINED IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT, AND IS THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS (DHR) REVIEW COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED BECAUSE THE LOT NUMBER OF THE PRODUCT WAS NOT REPORTED. THROMBOTIC EVENTS ARE A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. PATIENTS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE AT HIGH-RISK FOR THROMBOTIC EVENTS INCLUDE THOSE WITH LONG LESIONS, A VESSEL DIAMETER LESS THAN 3MM AND PREVIOUS THROMBUS. THE IFU INDICATES THAT PATIENTS SHOULD RECEIVE CLOPIDOGREL OR TICLOPIDINE FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS POST PROCEDURE, AND ASPIRIN INDEFINITELY. SINCE THE RELATIVE RISK OF STENT THROMBOSIS WITH CYPHER STENT IS EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF A BARE METAL STENT, THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD USE BEST CLINICAL JUDGEMENT IN DETERMINING THE NEED FOR A MORE EXTENDED DURATION OF ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS, AS THEY WOULD WHEN USING A BARE METAL STENT. WITH SUCH LIMITED PATIENT AND PROCEDURAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW, THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT'S LOT NUMBER TO PERFORM A DHR REVIEW AND THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT TO ANALYZE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PATIENT'S DEATH. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE INITIAL/FINAL REPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT.
THE REPORT RECEIVED THROUGH THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE-YEAR AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE MALE PATIENT EXPERIENCED VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS THAT LEAD TO A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND DEATH. THE PATIENT HAD AN UNKNOWN CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL/MID CIRCUMFLEX DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE."
