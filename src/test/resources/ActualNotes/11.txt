APPROXIMATELY FOUR (4) MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, WHILE UNDERGOING DIALYSIS THE PT WENT INTO VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION AND CARDIAC ARREST. THE PT WAS PUT ON PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY SUPPORT (PCPS) SYSTEM AND A RESPIRATOR. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) AND EMERGENCY CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS DONE. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY DEMONSTRATED THROMBUS IN THE CYPHER STENT THAT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) CORONARY ARTERY AND DISTAL TO THE STENT. THE THROMBOSIS WAS TREATED BY ASPIRATION OF THE THROMBUS AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. THE PT EXPIRED ONE (1) WEEK AFTER THE ADVERSE EVENT (AE) DUE TO CARDIAC FAILURE AND REDUCED CARDIAC FUNCTION. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE LATE THROMBOSIS WAS THAT THE PT MAY HAVE BEEN DEHYDRATED DUE TO THE HEMODIALYSIS CAUSING REDUCED BLOOD FLOW AND THE THROMBOSIS.
