"RESULTS AND CONCLUSION SUMMATION: PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING DETERMINED THAT ANGINA, THROMBOSIS, AND DEATH, AS LISTED IN THE XIENCE V INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) ARE KNOWN ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENTING AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE. ANGINA, THROMBOSIS, CARDIAC ARREST, AND DEATH ARE LISTED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT AS POST PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ANGINA AND CARDIAC ARREST ARE SECONDARY EFFECTS OF THE THROMBOSIS WHICH RESULTED IN DEATH. A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED PT EFFECTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRODUCT, IF ANY, CANNOT BE DETERMINED.
REPORTING STATUS: DEATH. REPORTING RATIONALE: STENT THROMBOSIS; SUBSEQUENT PT DEATH. DEVICE ISSUE: THROMBOSIS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN 2007, THE PT CAME TO THE HOSPITAL WITH AN IN-STENT RESTENOSIS OF THE PROXIMAL / MID LAD. IN THE NEXT DAY, A XIENCE V 3.0 X 28 MM WAS IMPLANTED TO TREAT THE RESTENOSIS; HOWEVER, THE PT RETURNED IN 2009, WITH SEVERE CHEST PAIN, AND THE ANGIOGRAM REVEALED STENT THROMBOSIS. THE LAD WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED. THE PT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST ON THE TABLE, WHILE THE ANGIOGRAM WAS BEING PERFORMED, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIED. NO ADDITIONAL EVENT OR PT INFO IS AVAILABLE."
