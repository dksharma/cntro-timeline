IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, LATE STENT THROMBOSIS AND DEATH OCCURRED. THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN 2009. STENOSED LESIONS WERE LOCATED IN A DISTAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY AND MODERATELY TORTUOUS AND NON-CALCIFIED MID TO DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY AND SECOND DIAGONAL BRANCH. THE PHYSICIAN IMPLANTED AN UNKNOWN BARE METAL STENT IN THE DISTAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY AND ELECTED TO NOT TREAT THE LESION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY AT THAT TIME. APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS LATER, THE PATIENT RETURNED TO THE CATH LAB FOR TREATMENT OF THE LESION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH AN UNKNOWN BALLOON. A 2.5X24MM NON-BSC STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY TO THE SECOND DIAGONAL BRANCH. A 3.0X20MM TAXUS LIBERTE' DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS INSERTED THROUGH THE NON-BSC STENT AND DEPLOYED IN THE MID TO DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY, OVERLAPPING THE NON-BSC STENT. THE BALLOON FROM THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS USED TO POST-DILATE. THE STENTS WERE WELL APPOSED AND NO GAP BETWEEN THE STENTS WAS NOTED. NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON 200MG TICLOPIDINE AND 100MG ASPIRIN DAILY. APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS AFTER THE IMPLANT OF THE TAXUS LIBERTE' STENT, THE PATIENT PRESENTED IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. THE MID TO DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY, SECOND DIAGONAL BRANCH AND RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY WERE COMPLETELY OCCLUDED WITH THROMBUS. THE THROMBUS WAS ASPIRATED AND ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED WITH BOTH A 1.5X15MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON AS WELL AS A 2.5X20MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON. AN IABP CATHETER WAS INSERTED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT THINK THE PRODUCT OR THE STENTING PROCEDURE IS RELATED TO THE PATIENT DEATH. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT LIVES ALONE AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE PATIENT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLIANT WITH MEDICATION BASED ON THE PHYSICIAN'S PRIOR EXPERIENCES WITH THE PATIENT. IT WAS FURTHER NOTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD BEEN NON-COMPLIANT WITH FOLLOW-UP VISITS TO HIS PHYSICIAN AND HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE.
