SAME CASE AS: 2134265-2009-02551. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, A THROMBOSIS AND DEATH OCCURRED. IN 2005, THE PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH CHEST PAIN RADIATING INTO THE LEFT ARM. SHORTNESS OF BREATH, ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES AND NON-SPECIFIC ST-T WAVE CHANGES. THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED AND THE NEXT DAY CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED AND ONE INSTANCE OF IDIOVENTRICULAR RHYTHM WAS NOTED. THE PATIENT WAS SENT TO THE CATH LAB WHERE 90% STENOSIS OF BOTH THE OBTUSE MARGINAL BRANCH AND THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY WAS FOUND. A 2.5X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS ADVANCED, BUT COULD NOT CROSS THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS ADVANCED TO THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY AND INFLATED TO 12 ATMS FOR 1 MINUTE. THE PATIENT REPORTED CHEST PAIN UPON INFLATION THAT SUBSIDED WHEN THE BALLOON WAS DEFLATED. THE 2.5X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS REINSERTED AND DEPLOYED IN THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE FIRST OBTUSE MARGINAL BRANCH AT 14 ATMS FOR 120 SECONDS TO A DIAMETER OF 2.79MM. THE PHYSICIAN THEN ATTEMPTED TO ADVANCE A 2.5X12MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT INTO THE LESION PAST THE FIRST DEPLOYED STENT, BUT COULD NOT CROSS THE PLACED STENT. THE 2.5X12MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS REINSERTED AND INFLATED TO 14 ATMS FOR 60 SECONDS, 14 ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS AND 16 ATMS FOR 60 SECONDS. THE PHYSICIAN WAS STILL UNABLE TO CROSS THE PLACED STENT AND DISTAL STENOSIS. THE GUIDE CATHETER AND GUIDEWIRE WERE EXCHANGED AND THE 2.5X12MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS ADVANCED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY TO THE PROXIMAL ONE THIRD OF THE CIRCUMFLEX MARGINAL BRANCH JUST DISTAL TO THE FIRST STENT. THE STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 14 ATMS FOR 120 SECONDS. THE PHYSICIAN SUCCESSFULLY STENTED THE OBTUSE MARGINAL BRANCH, HOWEVER; THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY COULD NOT BE STENTED SO AGGRESSIVE MEDICAL THERAPY WAS ALSO STARTED. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT IN STABLE CONDITION. PRIOR TO INTERVENTION THE PATIENT WAS ON NO MEDICATIONS. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON 75MG PLAVIX DAILY, 50MG ATENOLOL DAILY, ASPIRIN DAILY, 20MG LIPITOR DAILY AND 5MG NORVASC DAILY. IN 2006, THE PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH RECURRENT CHEST PAIN, DIAPHORESIS AND MINOR ST SEGMENT CHANGES. NO PCI WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ANGINA AND STARTED ON TOPICAL NITRATES AND ATENOLOL IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING PLAVIX, NORVASC, LIPITOR AND ASPIRIN. AT APPROX 6 MONTHSLATER, THE PATIENT AS SEEN AGAIN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR CHEST PAIN, NAUSEA AND BILATERAL ARM TINGLING. THE PATIENT WAS RELEASED AND MEDICALLY MANAGED. AT ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, THE PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AFTER 40 MINUTES OF CHEST PAIN, HAVING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE ON PLAVIX AND CADUET. WHILE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM THE PATIENT WENT INTO A VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION ARREST AND WAS CARDIOVERTED BACK INTO A NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM. THE PATIENT WAS TAKEN EMERGENTLY TO THE CATH LAB WHERE HE EXPERIENCED REPEATED EPISODES OF BRADYCARDIA AND HYPOTENSION NECESSITATING A TRANSVENOUS PACEMAKER. CATHETERIZATION SHOWED IN-STENT RESTENOSIS WITH EVIDENCE OF THROMBOSIS IN THE OBTUSE MARGINAL STENT WITH A SUBTOTAL CIRCUMFLEX AND A TOTALLY OCCLUDED LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY BEYOND A LARGE DIAGONAL THAT HAD 60% STENOSIS. THE PHYSICIAN OPINION WAS THAT WITH THE OCCLUDED LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY, HE WAS A POOR CANDIDATE FOR PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTION OF THE FIRST OBTUSE MARGINAL ARTERY WHICH WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY, WHICH WAS THE PATIENT'S ONLY REMAINING PATENT ARTERY. AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP WAS PLACED AND THE PATIENT WAS SENT FOR EMERGENCY BYPASS GRAFTING. THE PHYSICIAN STATED THAT AT THAT TIME THE PATIENT'S PROGNOSIS WAS POOR AND THE SHORT TERM MORTALITY HIGH. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A QUADRUPLE CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS WITH SEQUENTIAL LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY TO DIAGONAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY AND SEQUENTIAL REVERSE SAPHENOUS VEIN AORTA CORONARY BYPASS TO THE FIRST AND SECOND OBTUSE MARGINALS OF THE CIRCUMFLEX. POST QUADRUPLE BYPASS THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE ICU IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION. SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING IN THE ICU, THE PATIENT HAD A RAPID DECLINE IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND WAS SPEWING PULMONARY EDEMA FLUID FROM HIS ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE. HIS OXYGEN SATURATION IMMEDIATELY DECLINED AND CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS CARRIED OUT. MULTIPLE BLOOD GASES SHOWED COMBINED METABOLIC AND RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS WITH A PROLONGED HYPOXEMIA. THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN MULTIPLE DOSES OF SODIUM BICARBONATE, VIGOROUS VENTILATION, EPINEPHRINE AND CONTINUES LEVOPHED DRIP. DURING THE RESUSCITATION THE PATIENT DEVELOPED VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION THAT REQUIRED TWO CARDIOVERSIONS BACK TO JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WHICH COULD NOT BE CAPTURED WITH PACING. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS CONTINUED FOR 30 MINUTES UNTIL THERE WAS NO PULSE OR BLOOD PRESSURE AND ONLY AN AGONAL RHYTHM. AT THAT TIME MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS STOPPED AND THE PATIENT EXPIRED.
