IT WAS REPORTED IN JOURNAL ARTICLE THAT CHRONIC STENT THROMBOSIS, PATIENT COMPLICATIONS AND A STENT PROFILE PROBLEM OCCURRED. THE LESION WAS LOCATED IN A CHRONICALLY OCCLUDED LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. RECANALISATION OF THE LESION WITH MULTIPLE TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENTS WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON CLOPIDOGREL. NO PATIENT INJURIES WERE REPORTED. APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER, THE PATIENT HAD DISCONTINUED CLOPIDOGREL AND PRESENTED WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME. ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED AND THE STENTS WERE FOUND TO BE PATENT WITH TIMI III FLOW. AN AREA OF RADIOLUCENCE WAS NOTED WITHIN THE STENTED VESSEL WITH NO CLEAR SIGNIFICANCE. NO FURTHER INTERVENTION WAS UNDERGONE AT THAT TIME AND THE PATIENT WAS RESTARTED ON CLOPIDOGREL. AN UNKNOWN TIME LATER A REPEAT ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED RADIOLUCENT AREA WITHIN THE STENT. AN OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY SCAN REVEALED THAT THE STENT STRUTS WERE WELL COVERED; HOWEVER, THERE WAS INTRALUMINAL, LAMINATED MASS EXTENDING WITHIN THE STENT STRUTS IN THE MID PORTION OF THE STENT. IVUS CONFIRMED A CHRONIC THROMBUS WITHIN THE INTIMA, PROTRUDING THROUGH THE STENT STRUTS. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE STENT WAS UNDERSIZED FOR THE VESSEL AND THAT THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE THROMBOSIS WAS STRUT IN-APPOSITION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED BUT IS NOT AVAILABLE.
