(B)(4). SAME CASE AS MFR ID: 2134265-2010-04380. SAME PATIENT AS MFR ID: 2134265-2010-04475, 2134265-2010-04474. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, IN STENT RESTENOSIS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND STENT THROMBOSIS OCCURRED. IN (B)(6)-2005, DUE TO ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. ACCESS WAS GAINED VIA THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY. THREE LESIONS WERE TREATED AT THIS PROCEDURE. A TUBULAR 85% STENOSED, 10MM LONG, CONCENTRIC, TYPE "B1" LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE MILDLY CALCIFIED MID SECOND OBTUSE MARGINAL (OM2) WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. AN 8F 100CM NON BSC GUIDE CATHETER WAS ADVANCED FOLLOWED BY A 0.014" 190CM NON BSC GUIDE WIRE THAT WAS USED TO CROSS THE OM2. A 2.5X12MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT WAS ADVANCED AND REMOVED. A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON WAS USED TO PREDILATE THE LESION AT 8ATM FOR 60 SECONDS. THE 2.5X12MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS AGAIN ADVANCED AND WAS DEPLOYED AT 12ATM FOR 45 SECONDS. ADDITIONAL POST DILATION PERFORMED WITH THE STENT BALLOON AT 2ATM FOR 10 SECONDS RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON WAS REMOVED. THE SECOND LESION TREATED WAS A TUBULAR 80% STENOSED, 20MM LONG, CONCENTRIC, TYPE "B1" LESION IN THE MILDLY CALCIFIED PROXIMAL FIRST OBTUSE MARGINAL (OM1) WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. THE NON BSC GUIDE WIRE WAS THEN ADVANCED DOWN THE LCX ALONG WITH ANOTHER 0.014" 180CM NON BSC GUIDE WIRE THAT WAS DIRECTED TO THE OM1. A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON WAS ADVANCED INTO THE OM1 AND USED TO PREDILATE THE LESION AT 2 INFLATIONS TO 6ATM, 20 SECONDS AND 10 SECONDS. THE 2.5X24MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT WAS THEN ADVANCED AND DEPLOYED IN THE OM1 AT 9ATM FOR 30 SECONDS. A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS USED TO POST DILATE THE STENT AT 16ATM FOR 15 SECONDS RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THE THIRD LESION TREATED WAS A 70% STENOSED, 20MM LONG, CONCENTRIC, TYPE "B1" LESION LOCATED IN THE MILDLY CALCIFIED PROXIMAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX) WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. A NON BSC GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED DOWN THE LCX. A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON WAS ADVANCED AND PREDILATED THE LESION AT 12ATM FOR 30 SECONDS. A 3.0X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT WAS ADVANCED TO THE LESION AND DEPLOYED AT 12ATM FOR 20 SECONDS. ANOTHER NON BSC 0.014" 180CM GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED DOWN THE OM1 AND A 2.5X12MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON WAS INFLATED AT 8ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. THE TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON WAS ADVANCED ALONG WITH A 2.5X15MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON FOR A KISSING BALLOON TECHNIQUE. THE MAVERICK2 BALLOON WAS INFLATED AT 8ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. FINAL RESULT WAS 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THE PROCEDURE WAS CLOSED WITHOUT PATIENT COMPLICATIONS. IN (B)(6)-2007, DUE TO ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENTS WERE FOUND TO BE PATENT. HOWEVER, A NEW LESION WAS IDENTIFIED. A 70% STENOSED, 10MM LONG, ECCENTRIC, "HIGH RISK" LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE MODERATELY CALCIFIED LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY (LMCA) WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. IT WAS TREATED WITH PLACEMENT OF A 3.0X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THERE WERE NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS REPORTED DURING THE PROCEDURE. IN (B)(6)-2007, DUE TO ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA ON EXERTION, THE PATIENT RETURNED FOR CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. A 75% STENOSED, 5MM LONG, ECCENTRIC AND HIGH RISK LESION WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE SEVERELY CALCIFIED MID LMCA WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. IT WAS TREATED WITH AN UNKNOWN SIZE TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. A 70% STENOSED, 5MM LONG, CONCENTRIC, NON-HIGH RISK LESION WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE MILDLY CALCIFIED OSTIAL 1ST OM WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. IT WAS TREATED WITH PLAIN OLD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (POBA) RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THERE WERE NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS REPORTED DURING THE PROCEDURE. IN (B)(6)-2010, DUE TO UNSTABLE ANGINA AND EVIDENCE OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. A 15MM LONG, 90% STENOSED, TUBULAR, CONCENTRIC, HIGH RISK RESTENOTIC LESION WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE MODERATELY CALCIFIED PROXIMAL-MID LCX WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. ADDITIONALLY, AN 80% STENOSED LESION WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE PROXIMAL OM1. A 0.014" 180CM NON BSC GUIDE WIRE WAS USED TO REACH THE LESION IN THE LCX. A 2.5X15MM NON BSC BALLOON WAS ADVANCED TO THE LESION AND DILATED ONCE AT 18ATM FOR 15 SECONDS AND AGAIN AT 20ATM FOR 10 SECONDS. THEN A 3.0X15MM PROMUS STENT WAS ADVANCED TO THE LESION AND DEPLOYED AT 18ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. A 3.5X10MM NON-BSC BALLOON WAS ADVANCED FOR POST DILATION AT 22ATM FOR 15, 10 AND 8 SECONDS. THE WIRE WAS THEN DIRECTED DOWN THE OM1 AND A 2.0X8MM QUANTUM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS USED TO DILATE THE OM1 LESION AT 22ATM FOR 20 SECONDS AND THE PROCEDURE WAS CLOSED. RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS REPORTED TO BE 0% FOR THE LCX AND 40% FOR THE OM1 AND TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. AT 1 WEEK LATER, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH ANGINA AND A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REVEALED A SUBACUTE CLOSURE OF THE MID LCX. THROMBUS WAS REPORTED TO BE PRESENT. THE LESION WAS 100% STENOSED, NON-HIGH RISK, 20MM LONG, CONCENTRIC WITH TIMI-0 FLOW AND MODERATE CALCIFICATION OF THE VESSEL. THERE WAS ALSO A 45% STENOSED, NON HIGH RISK, 12MM LONG, CONCENTRIC LESION IDENTIFIED IN THE MILDLY CALCIFIED OSTIAL OM1 WITH TIMI-3 FLOW. A 0.014" 180CM NON BSC GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED TO THE LCX FOLLOWED BY A 2.5X12MM APEX FLEX BALLOON WHICH WAS INFLATED TO 8ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. THE AREA WAS THEN TREATED WITH AN EXPORT CATHETER. FOLLOWING INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) A NON BSC NON COMPLIANT 3.5X15MM BALLOON WAS ADVANCED DOWN THE LCX AND TWO TIMES AT 26ATM FOR 20 SECONDS AND ONE TIME AT 12ATM FOR 30 SECONDS. A 2.0X15MM APEX FLEX BALLOON WAS THEN ADVANCED AND INFLATED ONCE AT 16ATM FOR 25 SECONDS AND AGAIN AT 12ATM FOR 30 SECONDS IN A KISSING BALLOON TECHNIQUE INVOLVING THE OSTIAL OM1. IVUS WAS AGAIN PERFORMED AND THE PROCEDURE WAS CLOSED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD ST ELEVATION DURING THE PROCEDURE. POST TREATMENT RESIDUAL STENOSIS OF THE MID LCX WAS REPORTED TO BE 5% WITH TIMI-3 FLOW RESTORED. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN STENOSIS TO THE OM1 POST TREATMENT. TIMI-3 FLOW WAS MAINTAINED. THE SITE INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THROMBOSIS. HOWEVER, THE PHYSICIAN ALSO COMMENTED THAT "ONCE THE VESSEL WAS REOPENED, THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH THROMBUS AT ALL. THE EXPORT CATHETER YIELDED NO THROMBUS. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MECHANICAL ISSUE FOR SOME REASON WITHIN THE LCX STENT SITE."
