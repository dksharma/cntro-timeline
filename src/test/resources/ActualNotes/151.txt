AS REPORTED VIA THE (B)(4) STUDY, A PATIENT EXPERIENCED ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI), IN-STENT THROMBOSIS, AND MULTIPLE STENT FRACTURES APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE. THE INDICATION FOR THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS UNSTABLE ANGINA. THE TARGET LESIONS WERE IN THE RAMUS INTERMEDIUS AND PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERIES. THE RAMUS LESION WAS DE NOVO, AHA/ACC CLASSIFICATION TYPE C, 80MM IN LENGTH. THE REFERENCE VESSEL WAS 2.5MM IN DIAMETER. THE LAD LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS DE NOVO, BIFURCATED, AHA/ACC CLASSIFICATION TYPE C AND 60MM IN LENGTH. THE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.5 TO 3.5MM. THE RAMUS LESION WAS TREATED FIRST. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED. TWO 2.5 X 28MM CYPHERS AND TWO 2.5 X 18MM CYPHERS WERE IMPLANTED WITH OVERLAP. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE STENTS WERE POST-DILATED. APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK LATER, THE PROXIMAL LAD LESION WAS TREATED. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED. A 2.5 X 28MM CYPHER WAS IMPLANTED AT 18ATM, A 3.0 X 18MM CYPHER WAS IMPLANTED AT 16ATM, AND A 3.5 X 23MM CYPHER WAS IMPLANTED AT 18ATM IN OVERLAPPING FASHION DISTAL TO PROXIMAL. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE STENTS WERE POST-DILATED.
