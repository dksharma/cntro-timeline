(B) (4) CLINICAL STUDY. SAME CASE AS MFR ID#: 2134265-2010-02391. IT WAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A CORONARY ARTERY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN, ST ELEVATION, STENT THROMBOSIS AND IN STENT RESTENOSIS. THE 95% STENOSED AND 10MM LONG BIFURCATED DE NOVO TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (LCX) WITH A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 3MM. THE LESION WAS TREATED WITH DIRECT STENTING OF A 3.0X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT PROXIMALLY WITH A MAXIMUM INFLATION PRESSURE OF 16 ATM FOLLOWED BY PLACEMENT OF AN OVERLAPPING 2.5X8MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT DISTALLY. NO COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED. MEDICATIONS TAKEN AT TIME OF INDEX PROCEDURE INCLUDED BIVALIRUDIN, ASPIRIN, CLOPIDOGREL, BETABLOCKERS, ACE INHIBITORS AND STATINS. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED 4 DAYS LATER. 747 DAYS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH CHEST PAIN AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ST ELEVATION VIA ECG AND SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. CURRENT MEDICATION INCLUDED CARDILOC, PRAVALIP, TRITAC, AND ASPIRIN. ANGIOGRAPHY IDENTIFIED THROMBOSIS IN THE LCX AT THE OVERLAPPING SEGMENT OF THE TWO PREVIOUSLY PLACED TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENTS WITH TIMI-0 FLOW. FOLLOWING THROMBECTOMY, TIMI-3 FLOW RESUMED AND RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 70%. THE REMAINING LESION WAS TREATED WITH PLACEMENT OF A DRUG ELUTING STENT OVERLAPPING WITH THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENTS RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. THE EVENT WAS CONSIDERED RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT DISCHARGED 4 DAYS LATER. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN THAT THIS EVENT IS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE TAXUS EXPRESS2 DEVICE.
