AS REPORTED IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE, VOLUME 11, ISSUE 3, JULY-SEPTEMBER 2010, PAGES 172-174, IN "SIMULTANEOUS DUAL CORONARY VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS FOLLOWING NONCARDIAC SURGERY," SIMULTANEOUS STENT THROMBOSIS OCCURRED IN TWO CORONARY ARTERIES FOLLOWING DISCONTINUATION OF CLOPIDOGREL FOR AN ELECTIVE NON-CARDIAC SURGERY 3 YEARS AFTER DES PLACEMENT. THE PATIENT DID WELL UNTIL HE PRESENTED AGAIN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) IN (B)(6) 2007 WITH SEVERE RETROSTERNAL CHEST PAIN AND DIFFUSE ST ELEVATIONS IN THE ANTERIOR AND INFERIOR LEADS ON ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. THIS EVENT OCCURRED 5 DAYS AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL SPINAL FIXATION SURGERY, WHICH HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY A WEEK OF INTERRUPTED CLOPIDOGREL THERAPY WHILE REMAINING ON ASPIRIN. IN THE ER, THE PATIENT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST WITH EPISODES OF BOTH VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF) AND PULSELESS VT AND, AFTER SUCCESSFUL RESUSCITATION, WAS EMERGENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY WHERE CORONARY ANGIOGRAM REVEALED OCCLUSION OF BOTH HIS MID-RCA AND MID-LAD STENTS CONSISTENT WITH DEFINITE STENT THROMBOSIS. THE PATIENT WAS STARTED ON INTRAVENOUS AMIODARONE. BOTH THE MID-LAD AND MID-RCA LESIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH BARE METAL STENTS (BMS). INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND CONFIRMED EXCELLENT STENT APPOSITION AND NO EDGE DISSECTION. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED INCESSANT VT AND VF AND RECEIVED MULTIPLE ICD-DELIVERED SHOCKS. DESPITE INTRAAORTIC BALLOON PUMP PLACEMENT AND ADVANCED CARDIAC LIFE SUPPORT PROTOCOL GUIDED PROLONGED RESUSCITATION ATTEMPT, THE PATIENT EXPIRED. THE (B)(6) MALE PATIENT RECEIVED HIS FIRST PACLITAXEL DRUG-ELUTING STENT (DES) IN (B)(6) 2004 ON HIS MIDDLE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) AFTER PRESENTING WITH AN ANTERIOR ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI). HE RETURNED 5 MONTHS LATER WITH CHEST PAIN AND A NON-STEMI. REPEAT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REVEALED LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION OF 35% AND IN-STENT RESTENOSIS OF HIS PRIOR LAD STENT AS WELL AS PROGRESSIVE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) DISEASE, BOTH TREATED WITH SIROLIMUS DES IMPLANTS. LATER THAT DAY, THE PATIENT HAD A DOCUMENTED EPISODE OF SUSTAINED VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (VT) AND WAS TAKEN EMERGENTLY FOR REPEAT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION, WHICH REVEALED PATENT'S STENTS. THE PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED AN IMPLANTABLE CARDIAC DEFIBRILLATOR (ICD) AND WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON LIFELONG DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY (DAPT) WITH ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL. THE PRODUCTS REMAIN IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT AND ARE THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. THROMBOSIS IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES. NARROWING OF THE IN-STENT LUMEN AND CESSATION OF ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN COMBINATION MAY LEAD TO THROMBUS FORMATION RESULTING IN VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS THAT MAY LEAD TO CARDIAC ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT DEATH. REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PATIENT'S EXTENSIVE CAD, LOW EJECTION FRACTION AND CESSATION OF ANTIPLATELET THERAPY IN PREPARATION FOR SPINAL FIXATION SURGERY, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENTS. THIS IS ONE OF TWO DEVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED EVENT THAT WERE SUBMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING MANUFACTURING NUMBERS 3003742446-2010-00305 AND 3003742446-2010-00306.
