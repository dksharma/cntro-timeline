IT WAS REPORTED VIA A LITERATURE ARTICLE THAT VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS OCCURRED. THE SUBJECT PRESENTED WITH RECURRENT DIZZINESS AND DIPLOPIA. MRI SHOWED AN INFARCTION OF THE RIGHT CEREBELLAR HEMISPHERE. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED A 60% STENOSIS OF THE RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND A TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY. TO PREVENT FURTHER PROGRESSION OF THE EXISTING STROKE, STENTING WAS PERFORMED. A 6F GUIDE CATHETER WAS POSITIONED IN THE RIGHT DISTAL VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND CROSSED WITH A TRANSEND GUIDE WIRE. A 4.5X16MM TAXUS STENT WAS ADVANCED BUT WAS UNABLE TO CROSS DUE TO THE VESSEL TORTUOSITY. A SECOND GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED DISTAL TO THE TORTUOUS SEGMENT, BUT THE SAME STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS AGAIN UNABLE TO CROSS THE LESION. A 0.035" GUIDE WIRE WAS INSERTED PROXIMAL TO THE STENOTIC SEGMENT AND THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED. THE TAXUS STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 10ATM FOR 20 SECONDS. POST-STENT ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED SUCCESSFUL DILATION OF THE INTRACRANIAL VERTEBRAL ARTERY STENOSIS WITH NORMAL DISTAL BLOOD FLOW. THERE WERE NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS DURING OR AFTER THE PROCEDURE. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL DAILY FOR ONE YEAR. AT THE 16 MONTH FOLLOW UP NO SYMPTOMS HAD RECURRED AND CLOPIDOGREL THERAPY WAS DISCONTINUED. THE PATIENT RETURNED WITH DIZZINESS AND DIPLOPIA. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED FILLING DEFECTS AND "MALAPPOSITION" OF THE DISTAL STENT EDGE. DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY AND ANTICOAGULATION DRUGS WERE RESTARTED IMMEDIATELY. A CONTROL ANGIOGRAM FOUR WEEKS POST EVENT SHOWED NO ABNORMALITY WITHIN THE STENT. THE PATIENT RECOVERED WELL AND REMAINED NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT.
