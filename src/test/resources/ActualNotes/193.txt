THIS (B)(4) CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENT IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENT. INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM AN AFFILIATE INDICATED THAT A PATIENT EXPERIENCED STENT FRACTURE AND A VERY LATE THROMBOTIC EVENT AFTER HAVING CORONARY ARTERY STENTS IMPLANTED. THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY IS SIGNIFICANT FOR ANGINA, HYPERTENSION, ABNORMALITY OF LIPID METABOLISM, PAST HISTORY OF PCI, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND ARTERIOSCLEROSIS OBLITERANS. THE TARGET LESION WAS THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD). THE LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS AN IN-STENT RESTENOSIS, GREATER THAN 30MM LONG AND A VESSEL DIAMETER OF 3.0MM. THE LESION WAS DIRECT STENTED WITH 2.5MM X 18MM CYPHER STENT AT 16 ATMS IN THE DISTAL SECTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED BARE METAL STENT. A SECOND CYPHER (2.5MM/23MM) WAS THEN IMPLANTED INSIDE THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE BARE METAL STENT, OVERLAPPING THE FIRST STENT AT 16 ATMS. THE STENTS WERE NOT POST-DILATED AND THE REPORTED RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. APPROXIMATELY THREE AND A HALF YEARS LATER CHEST PAIN INSPIRED ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED A CONCENTRIC STENT FRACTURE IN THE SECOND CYPHER STENT WHERE IT OVERLAPPED WITH THE PROXIMAL PART OF THE BARE METAL STENT. THROMBUS WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE FRACTURED PORTION OF THE STENT. THE EVENT WAS TREATED WITH ASPIRATION AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. THE PATIENT WAS ON ASPIRIN TICLOPIDINE, WHICH WAS SWITCHED TO CILOSTAZOL ABOUT ONE MONTH PRIOR TO THE EVENT. PHYSICIAN'S COMMENT: THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS THE EFFECT OF THE STENT FRACTURE, DIFFUSED LESION, UNDER-SIZED STENT, OVERLAPPING IMPLANTATION AND ISR LESION. THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE STENT FRACTURE WAS ISR LESION, OVERLAPPING IMPLANTATION AND DIFFUSED LESION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. STENT FRACTURE AND THROMBOSIS ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLANTING CORONARY ARTERY STENTS. WHILE NOT OBSERVED IN THE PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS THAT SUPPORTED THE CYPHER STENT PMA, STENT FRACTURES ARE UNCOMMON EVENTS BUT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN LONG STENTED SEGMENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN CORONARY SEGMENTS THAT UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT MOTION, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WITH SEVERE ANGULATION, TORTUOSITY AND CALCIFICATION. IN THE CYPHER STENT, THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED MOST OFTEN IN CERTAIN LESION SUBGROUPS IN WHICH SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. STENT FRACTURE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF THROMBOSIS AND RESTENOSIS AND MAY BE RELATED TO LOSS OF THE MECHANICAL SCAFFOLDING OF THE STENT AS WELL AS TO INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA AT THE SITE OF VESSEL WALL INJURY. REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT.
