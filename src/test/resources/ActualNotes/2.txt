IT WAS REPORTED THAT AFTER A CORONARY ARTERY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, A SUB-ACUTE THROMBUS OCCURRED. IN 2003, A TAXUS EXPRESS2 8.8% 2.75 MM X 24 MM STENT WAS PLACED IN A 90% STENOSED. NON CALCIFIED LAD LESION. AT THE SAME TIME, ANOTHER STENT (HELI) WAS PLACED IN THE RCA. THE LAD WAS PREDILATED BEFORE THE TAXUS STENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED. THE FINAL ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULT REVEALED THE TAXUS STENT TO BE WELL POSITIONED AND WELL APPOSED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PLAVIX WAS ADMINISTERED FOR LOADING AND POST PROCEDURE. THE PT'S CONDITION WAS REPORTED TO BE SATISFACTORY FOR 3 WEEKS AFTER INTERVENTION. IN 2004, THE PT RETURNED WITH CHEST PAIN AND EKG CHANGES. THE PT WAS TAKEN TO THE CATH LAB IN WHICH REPEAT ANGLOGRAPHY REVEALED A SUB-ACUTE THROMBOSIS IN THE LAD. THE PHYSICIAN TRIED TO PASS A WIRE THROUGH THE THROMBOSIS AND WAS UNABLE AS THE PT DEVELOPED CARDIAC ARREST. WHEN IV HEPARIN, NITROGLYCERIN, AND IV REOPRO WERE STARTED, THE WIRE WAS ABLE TO CROSS THROUGH THE LESION, BUT ONLY TIMI 1 FLOW WAS ACHIEVED. THE PT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE MICU WHERE PT SUBSEQUENTLY DIED AT 4 P.M. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN, THE THROMBOSIS WAS DOCUMENTED AND RELATED TO THE TAXUS STENT.
