THE GREATER THAN 50% STENOSED CONCENTRIC DE NOVO LESION WAS LOCATED AT A MODERATELY CALCIFIED AND NON-TORTUOUS BIFURCATION OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) AND THE FIRST DIAGONAL ARTERY. THE LAD WAS PREDILATED WITH A 3.0X15MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON AND THE BIFURCATION INTO THE FIRST DIAGONAL ARTERY WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X12 MAVERICK BALLOON. THREE STENTS WERE PLACED: A 3.0X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE PROXIMAL LAD, A 3.0X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE MID LAD AND A 2.5X8MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE FIRST DIAGONAL ARTERY. THE STENTS WERE PLACED NOT OVERLAPPING AND USING A REVERSE-T TECHNIQUE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LESION BEING AT A BIFURCATION. THE LESION WAS POST-DILATED WITH A 3.25X15MM QUANTUM MAVERICK IN THE LAD AND A 2.5X8MM QUANTUM MAVERICK IN THE BIFURCATION OF THE LAD INTO THE FIRST DIAGONAL. NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX. ONE YEAR AND NINE MONTHS LATER, THE PATIENT PRESENTED EMERGENTLY WITH CHEST PAIN, A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND IN-STENT VERY LATE THROMBOSIS. AN UNKNOWN TIME BEFORE THE EVENT THE PATIENT HAD STOPPED TAKING ALL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY.
