CONCOMITANT DEVICES ((B) (6) 2006): WATER GUIDE, CHOICE EXTRA SUPPORT WIRES, 2.5X8MM BALLOON, 2.5X12MM VISION STENT. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS ((B) (6) 2006): HEPARIN, INTEGRILIN AND PLAVIX. A (B) (6) MALE EXPERIENCED A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) DUE TO STENT THROMBOSIS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MONTHS POST IMPLANTATION OF A CYPHER STENT. THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDES: HYPERTENSION, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, OSTEOARTHRITIS, FAMILY HISTORY OF CAD AND CURRENT NICOTINE DEPENDENCE. THE INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE WAS ANGINA AND AN ABNORMAL STRESS TEST. A NUCLEAR SCAN REVEALED PRIOR INFERIOR AND INFEROAPICAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WITH MILD LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND AN EJECTION FRACTION OF 40%. THE PATIENT HAD A DIAGNOSTIC CATHETERIZATION WHICH REVEALED A TOTALLY OCCLUDED LAD. THE PHYSICIAN DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT TREATMENT OPTIONS INCLUDING MEDICAL THERAPY VERSUS BYPASS SURGERY VERSUS ATTEMPTING ANGIOPLASTY. THE PATIENT WAS INFORMED THAT ABOUT 50% SUCCESS RATE WITH PCI. THE PATIENT OPTED FOR THE PCI TREATMENT OPTION AND PCI WAS PERFORMED IN A TOTALLY OCCLUDED MID LAD AT THE BIFURCATION WITH THE FIRST DIAGONAL BRANCH. THE TYPE C LESION WAS PRE-DILATED BEFORE A 2.5X16MM TAXUS WAS IMPLANTED FOLLOWED BY A 2.5X8MM CYPHER IMPLANTED PROXIMALLY AND OVERLAPPING THE TAXUS STENT WITH SUCCESSFUL ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULTS. THERE WAS NO COMPROMISE OF THE DIAGONAL BRANCH. THE RESIDUAL DIAMETER STENOSIS WAS 0%. MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED AT DISCHARGE INCLUDED ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX AND THE PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO STOP SMOKING. APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS LATER, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A LEFT KNEE ARTHROPLASTY PERFORMED FOR SEVERE DEGREE DEGENERATIVE OSTEOARTHRITIS. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICAL RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT HAD STOPPED TAKING PLAVIX APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THE KNEE SURGERY. MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED AT DISCHARGE INCLUDED COUMADIN, LORTAB AND BACTRIM. APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS LATER, HE WAS EMERGENTLY HOSPITALIZED WITH CHEST PAIN AND DIAGNOSED WITH ANTERIOR APICAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED THE LAD WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUSLY STENTED SEGMENT PAST THE ORIGIN OF THE DIAGONAL BRANCH. SUCCESSFUL REVASCULARIZATION OF THE LAD WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY AND IMPLANTATION OF A COMPETITOR+S STENT WAS CONDUCTED WITH SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. HOWEVER, IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS POST PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT HAD VERY FREQUENT RUNS OF NONSYSTEMIC VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA. THE PATIENT WAS KEPT UNDER OBSERVATION ON THE TELEMETRY FLOOR AND DISCHARGED WITH PLANS FOR 24 HOLTER MONITORING TESTING. MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE INCLUDED ASPIRIN, PLAVIX AND CHANTIX. APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS POST THROMBOTIC EVENT, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF EXERTIONAL ANGINA TREATED MEDICALLY. THE PRODUCT REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT AND IS THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. THROMBOSIS WITH MI ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. CESSATION OF ANTIPLATELET THERAPY MAY LEAD TO THROMBUS FORMATION. THROMBUS DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE CARDIAC MUSCLE INDUCING AN MI. PATIENTS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE AT HIGH-RISK FOR THROMBOSIS INCLUDE THOSE WITH DIABETES, LONG LESIONS, SMALL VESSELS, BIFURCATIONS, AND RESTENOTIC LESIONS. THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF CYPHER PRODUCTS HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSIONS. THE IFU INDICATES THAT POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS OF THE CYPHER STENT WITH OTHER DRUG-ELUTING OR COATED STENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED WHENEVER POSSIBLE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, THERE ARE POSSIBLE PATIENT RISK FACTORS PRESENT IN THE MEDICAL HISTORY, SPECIFICALLY SMOKING, VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS (BIFURCATION) AND POSSIBLTHIS MALE PT HAD ONE CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED IN HIS PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) IN 2004, FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI). IN 2006, HE SUFFERED VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS, LEADING TO ANOTHER MI. THE PT UNDERWENT CARDIAC SURGERY IN 2004, FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. DURING THIS SURGERY, A CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN HIS PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. POST PROCEDURE, HE WAS PRESCRIBED PLAVIX FOR THREE MONTHS. IN 2006, THE PT SUFFERED A THROMBOSIS AT THE SITE OF THE STENT, CAUSING SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY, INCLUDING A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
E PROCEDURAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PATIENT'S THROMBOSIS AND SUBSEQUENT MI EVENTS.
