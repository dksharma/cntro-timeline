AS PUBLISHED IN THE ONLINE EDITION OF CASE REPORTS IN MEDICINE IN "LATE THROMBOSIS OF SIROLIMUS-ELUTING STENT: A MULTIFACTORIAL PROBLEM" AT 280 DAYS AFTER PCI IN THE PROXIMAL LAD WITH A 2.5 X 18 MM CYPHER STENT, A FEMALE PATIENT EXPERIENCED AN MI DUE TO THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION. THE PROXIMAL LAD SHOWED A POSITIVE VESSEL WALL REMODELING. NEAR THE DISTAL PART OF THE IMPLANTED STENT, A SEVERE STENT FRACTURE (SF) WAS FOUND WITH COMPLETE STRUT SEPARATION OVER A WIDE DISTANCE. THERE WAS ALSO A RESTENOSIS NOTED WITHIN THE GAP OF THE FRACTURE STENT. A FEMALE WITH HYPERTENSION, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, AND POSITIVE FAMILY HISTORY PRESENTED TO THE ED ONE HOUR AFTER THE ONSET OF A SEVERE CHEST DISCOMFORT HER ECG SHOWED MARKED ST-SEGMENT ELEVATIONS IN LEADS I, AVL, V1-4. SHE WAS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO THE CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY AFTER BEING GIVEN NITROGLYCERIN, MORPHINE, ASPIRIN, AND UFH. ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED A TIGHT THROMBOTIC LESION OF THE PROXIMAL LAD WITH A TIMI GRADE 2 BLOOD FLOW. AFTER ADDITIONAL ACT-GUIDED UFH AND 600 MG OF CLOPIDOGREL, A JL 3.5 F6 GUIDING CATHETER WAS USED TO INTUBATE THE LCA, A 0.014-INCH ASAHI SOFT GUIDE WIRE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE DISTAL LAD, A 2.0 X 20 MM MERCURY BALLOON WAS INFLATED ONCE AT 7 AT TO PRE-DILATE THE LESION, AND FINALLY A 2.5 X 18 MM CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED AT 16 AT ON THE PROXIMAL LAD. THE ANGIOGRAPHIC CONTROL SHOWED A GOOD RESULT AND, AS A RESULT, NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO EXPAND THE STENT WITH A NONCOMPLIANT BALLOON. FOLLOWING THE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE, THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE DAILY ASPIRIN 100 MG FOR LIFE, CLOPIDOGREL 75 MG FOR ONE YEAR, BISOPROLOL 2.5 MG. RAMIPRIL 2.5 MG, AND ATORVASTATIN 10 MG. SHE WAS DOING WELL UNTIL 280 DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY THE INTENSIVE CHEST PAIN ACCOMPANIED BY THE SWEATING AND NAUSEA. AT THE ED, HER HEART RATE WAS 60/MIN, BLOOD PRESSURE 90/60 MM HG, RESPIRATORY RATE 18/MIN, AND THERE WERE NO PULMONARY RATES. THE ECG DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ST-SEGMENT RE-ELEVATIONS IN LEADS V3-6. SHE RECEIVED SIMILAR MEDICATION AS PREVIOUSLY, AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY AGAIN. THE REPEAT ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED A THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION OF THE IMPLANTED STENT. AN EBU 3.75 F6 LAUNCHER GUIDING CATHETER WAS USED TO ENGAGE THE LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY, A 0.014 BMW GUIDE WIRE CROSSED THE STENT STRUTS EASILY, AND A 2.0 X 20 MM MERCURY BALLOON WAS GENTLY INFLATED AT 6 AT TO REOPEN THE LAD. AT THIS POINT, THE IVUS USING THE ATLANTIS 40MHZ TRANSDUCER WITH A MOTORIZED PULLBACK AT 0.5 MM/S WAS PERFORMED TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISM OF THE ST. THE PROXIMAL LAD SHOWED A POSITIVE VESSEL WALL REMODELING WITH MAXIMUM DIAMETERS WITHIN THE EXTERNAL ELASTIC MEMBRANE (EEM) AT BOTH STENT BORDER OF 4.5 MM AND 3.5 MM, RESPECTIVELY. THE VESSEL LUMEN, HOWEVER, WAS ENCROACHED BY A HUGE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE THAT COMPRISED 59% TO 74% OF THE MEASURED AREA WITHIN THE EEM AND EXTENDED CONSIDERABLY BEYOND THE OUTER STENT MARGINS. NEAR THE DISTAL PART OF THE IMPLANTED STENT, A SEVERE STENT FRACTURE (SF) WAS FOUND WITH COMPLETE STRUT SEPARATION OVER A WIDE DISTANCE. THE CROSS-SECTIONAL LUMEN AREA (CSA) AT THE SITE WITH MISSING STRUTS WAS ONLY 2.1MM2. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO ENLARGE THE STENT WITH THE BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. THE NONCOMPLIANT MERCURY NC 3.0 X 20 MM BALLOON WAS INFLATED SUCCESSIVELY ACROSS THE STENTED SEGMENT UP TO 20 AT WITH THE RESULTING CSA OF GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 6.5MM2. THE FINAL ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULT APPEARED EXCELLENT AND THEREFORE, THE PCI WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STENT PLACEMENT. THE PATIENT WAS THEN ADMITTED TO THE CCU WHERE TESTS ADDRESSING THE ANTIAGGREGATORY PLATELET FUNCTION WERE CARRIED OUT. THE POINT-OF-CARE TESTING USING VERIFYNOW DEMONSTRATED A GOOD ANTIAGGREGATORY EFFECT OF ASPIRIN WITH THE ARU OF 390 (NORMALLY, 620-672) AND, ON THE CONTRARY, A POOR RESPONSE TO CLOPIDOGREL WITH THE PRU OF 245 (NORMALLY, 194-418) AND ONLY 10% INHIBITION, SUGGESTING THE CLOPIDOGREL RESISTANCE. THE DAILY DOSE OF CLOPIDOGREL WAS RAISED TO 150 MG FOR THE NEXT YEAR. THE FURTHER HOSPITAL COURSE WAS UNEVENTFUL. SHE EXPERIENCED NO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE EVENTS UNTIL HER OUTPATIENT VISIT 6 MONTHS LATER. THE PRODUCT REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT AND IS THUS, NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER.
