THE TOTAL STENT LENGTH WAS 40MM. THE CYPHER STENT IS ONLY INDICATED FOR LESIONS OF LENGTH OF 40MM OR LESS. THE 130 DAYS POST PROCEDURE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED IN-STENT THROMBOSIS AND EXPIRED. THERE ARE LESION FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS.
