(B) (6); SAME PATIENT AS 2134265-2010-00345; SAME CASE AS 2134265-2010-00617, 2134265-2010-00636. IT WAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH IN STENT RESTENOSIS, THROMBOSIS AND A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE TOTALLY OCCLUDED TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 3.0X20MM MAVERICK BALLOON AT 8ATM IN THE PROXIMAL RCA, AND THEN TWO ADDITIONAL INFLATIONS OF 6ATM IN THE MID RCA. A 3.5X24 TAXUS EXPRESS2 WAS DEPLOYED MOST DISTALLY AT 16ATM, AND PLACED PROXIMAL OVERLAPPING AND TANDEM WAS A 3.5X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 AT 16ATM. PROXIMAL TO THAT STENT WAS ANOTHER OVERLAPPING AND TANDEM 3.5X8MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT DEPLOYED AT 18ATM RESULTING IN EXCELLENT ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULTS, 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW. INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) WAS PERFORMED WHICH SHOWED APPROPRIATE AND ACCEPTABLE RESULTS WITH ADEQUATE POSITIONING OF THE STENTS. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE STABLE AT DISCHARGE. AT 1245 DAYS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE INFERIOR ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. PRIOR TO TREATMENT, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED POLYMORPHIC VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA THAT DEGENERATED INTO VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION, WHICH WAS TREATED WITH CARDIOVERSION AT 200 JOULES. THIS OCCURRED 3 ADDITIONAL TIMES AND WAS TREATED WITH CARDIOVERSION EACH TIME UP TO A MAXIMUM OUTPUT OF 360 JOULES. THE PATIENT RECEIVED A TOTAL OF FOUR SHOCKS IN THREE MINUTES. LIDOCAINE WAS ALSO PROVIDED TO HELP STABILIZE HIS RHYTHM. THE PATIENT ALSO EXPERIENCED SEVERE SINUS BRADYCARDIA AND HIGH-GRADE SECOND-DEGREE AV BLOCK PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE. A TEMPORARY PACING WIRE WAS INSERTED AND ADVANCED UNDER FLUOROSCOPY AND POSITIONED IN THE RIGHT VENTRICULAR APEX AND WAS SET AT 50 BEATS PER MINUTE. EMERGENCY ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED 100% ACUTE TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE MID SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY, IN STENT RESTENOSIS AND STENT THROMBOSIS. A 3.0X15MM BALLOON WAS ADVANCED TO SUPPORT ADVANCEMENT OF THE GUIDEWIRE THROUGH THE OCCLUSION. INITIAL IMAGES SHOWED A DIFFUSE LARGE CLOT FORMATION IN THE MID TO DISTAL RCA. TWO PASSES WERE MADE WITH AN ASPIRATION CATHETER, FROM THE MID TO DISTAL SEGMENT, WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS CLEARING MOST OF THE INTRACORONARY CLOTS. IMAGING THEN CONFIRMED RESIDUAL 95% FOCAL STENOSIS IN THE MID STENT IN THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY. A 3.5X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS ADVANCED, AND INFLATED TWO TIMES IN THE MID SEGMENT AT 14ATM. THE BALLOON WAS THEN EXCHANGED TO A 4.0X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON, WHICH WAS INFLATED MULTIPLE TIMES UP TO 20ATM IN THE MID AND DISTAL RCA, RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND TIMI-3 FLOW AND GRADE 3 PERFUSION. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCES SOME CATHETER INDUCED SPASM IN THE PROXIMAL RCA DURING THE PROCEDURE, WHICH RESOLVED BY EXCHANGING THE CATHETER. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED 3 DAYS LATER.
