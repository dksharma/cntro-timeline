THE PT STATED IN A PHONE CALL TO MEDICAL AFFAIRS THAT HE HAD A CYPHER STENT PLACED IN AN UNKNOWN ARTERY FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON ON (B) (6) 2007. APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS AND TWO MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT STATED THAT HE EXPERIENCED AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE PT STATED THAT THIS WAS THE RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS CORDIS STENT COLLAPSING. THE PT STATED THAT HE HAD A SECOND CYPHER STENT PLACED IN AN UNKNOWN ARTERY AS TREATMENT. THE PT WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR TWO DAYS, AND WAS DISCHARGED ON (B) (6) 2009. THE EVENT WAS NOTED AS RESOLVED. A REVIEW OF THE PT'S MEDICAL RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE PT DID HAVE A 2.5 X 13MM CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED IN THE RCA ON (B) (6) 2007. ON (B) (6) 2009, WHILE BOWLING, THE PT DEVELOPED CHEST PAIN AND PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHERE HE BECAME UNCONSCIOUS. AT THAT TIME, THE PT WAS FOUND TO HAVE AN INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE PT UNDERWENT CATHETERIZATION ON (B) (6) 2009, AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE OCCLUSION OF THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY AT THE AREA OF THE PREVIOUSLY-IMPLANTED CYPHER STENT. THIS WAS RE-OPENED, DILATED, ASPIRATION THROMBECTOMY REALLY DID NOT REVEAL VERY MUCH. IT SEEMED LIKE A RESTENOTIC LESION. A 3X18 MM DRUG ELUTING XIENCE STENT WAS PLACED WITH EXCELLENT ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULT. IT WAS FELT THAT THE PT'S STENT THROMBOSIS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY RECENT STOPPAGE OF PLAVIX, SO WITH THE NEW DRUG ELUTING STENT, THE PT WAS STARTED ON EFFIENT 10MG DAILY WITH THE PLAN TO CONTINUE THAT FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN TO MOVE TO PLAVIX TO CONTINUE THAT INDEFINITELY.
