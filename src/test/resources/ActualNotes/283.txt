THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS DONE AFTER THE PT'S RECENT ANTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE PT WAS PRE-LOADED WITH 300 MG OF CLOPIDOGREL ORALLY AND HAD PRIMARY STENTING OF THE LAD DONE WITH A CYPHER SELECT PLUS 3.0 X 33 MM STENT. HEPARIN 1,000 UNITS WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY DURING THE PROCEDURE. AN EXCELLENT ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULT WAS REPORTEDLY ACHIEVED AND THE FLOW POST-PROCEDURE WAS REPORTED TO BE TIMI 3. THE PROCEDURE WAS UNEVENTFUL AND ASPIRIN 160 MG/DAY AND CLOPIDOGREL 75 MG/DAY WAS PRESCRIBED FOR SIX (6) MONTHS. THE PT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE REMAINED FREE OF SYMPTOMS AND THE CLOPIDOGREL WAS DISCONTINUED AFTER SIX (6) MONTHS. THE PT WAS FOLLOWED UP WITH AN EXERCISE TREADMILL TEST EVERY SIX (6) MONTHS. PLEASE NOTE THAT DEVICE IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION IN A LITERATURE ARTICLE. A MALE PT WITH A HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION AND SMOKING EXPERIENCED A THROMBOTIC EVENT TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS POST CYPHER SELECT PLUS STENT IMPLANTATION. INITIALLY, THE PT WAS ADMITTED WITH A RECENT MI AND UNDERWENT AN ANGIOGRAM THAT REVEALED A LESION IN HIS PROXIMAL LAD. PRE PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED PLAVIX; WHILE INTRA PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN. THE PRE OR INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA OR GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. NO VESSEL AND/OR LESION CHARACTERISTICS WERE REPORTED. THE LESION WAS NOT PRE-DILATED PRIOR TO THE PLACEMENT OF A 3.00 X 33 MM CYPHER SELECT PLUS STENT AT AN UNKNOWN MAXIMUM INFLATION PRESSURE. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A RESULTANT TIMI FLOW OF 3. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED ON MEDICATIONS THAT INCLUDED ASA AND PLAVIX. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS ASYMPTOMATIC AND HIS PLAVIX WAS DISCONTINUED. THE PT DID CONTINUE TAKING HIS ASA. TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH AN ACUTE ANTERIOR WALL MI. AN URGENT ANGIOGRAM REVEALED A CYPHER SELECT PLUS STENT THAT WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED WITH THROMBUS. THE TREATMENT OF THIS EVENT, IF ANY, WAS NOT REPORTED. OF NOTE, THE PT HAD UNDERGONE A TREADMILL EXERCISE TEST SEVEN DAYS BEFORE THESE EVENTS THAT HAD REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF ISCHEMIA. THE PRODUCT REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PT AND IS THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. IN ADDITION, A DHR REVIEW COULD NOT BE PERFORMED SINCE THE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT PROVIDED. THROMBOSIS IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE'S AUTHORS, THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS CASE ARGUES IN FAVOR OF PROLONGED DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY. BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW A CONCLUSION ABOUT A CLINICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEVICE AND THE EVENT. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE INITIAL/FINAL REPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT.
