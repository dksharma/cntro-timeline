AS REPORTED BY AN AFFILIATE, APPROXIMATELY 19 MONTHS AFTER A CYPHER STENT WAS PLACED IN A PT'S MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD), HE DEVELOPED INSTENT THROMBOSIS. AT THE TIME OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT UNDERWENT TREATMENT OF A MID LAD LESION THAT WAS DESCRIBED AS DE-NOVO, ECCENTRIC, BIFURCATED, AND 20MM IN LENGTH. THE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 3.0MM. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A 2.5 X 14MM BALLOON AT 10 ATM FOR 60 SECONDS. A 3.0 X 23MM CYPHER WAS IMPLANTED AT 16ATM FOR 30 SECONDS. POST-DILATION AND IVUS WAS NOT CONDUCTED. HEPARIN WAS ADMINISTERED INTRA-PROCEDURE (DOSE UNK). ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED THAT PLAQUE HAD SHIFTED TO THE FIRST DIAGONAL BRANCH, AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO TREAT THE PLAQUE SHIFT. RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0% AND TIMI FLOW WAS 3. THE STENT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE PATENT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE. APPROXIMATELY 19 MONTHS AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS HOSPITALIZED DUE TO CHEST PAIN. AN ECG REVEALED ST ELEVATION IN V1 TO V4. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED THROMBUS INSIDE THE CYPHER AND DISTALLY. THE THROMBUS WAS TREATED WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY AND SUFFICIENT BLOOD FLOW WAS RETURNED. THE PT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED WITH AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP. THE PT'S PEAK CREATINE KINASE (CK) LEVEL WAS 3030. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 15 DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION, THE PT WAS DISCHARGED. AT THE TIME OF THE THROMBOSIS, THE PT'S ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY INCLUDED ASPIRIN 100MG DAILY AND CLOPIDOGREL 300MG DAILY. TICLOPIDINE HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICIAN, THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS THE IMPLANTED CYPHER BEING UNDER-DILATED.
