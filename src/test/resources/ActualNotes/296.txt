IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, A THROMBOSIS OCCURRED. THE LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE TOTALLY OCCLUDED PROXIMAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X15MM NON-BSC BALLOON, WHICH DID NOT IMPROVE FLOW. THREE PASSES WITH A THROMBECTOMY CATHETER WERE MADE, INCREASING BLOOD FLOW. HOWEVER, THROMBUS STILL REMAINED. ADDITIONAL INFLATIONS WERE MADE WITH A 3.0X15MM NON-BSC BALLOON. A 3.00X28MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED, INFLATED TO 16ATM FOR 30 SECONDS. MODERATE DISEASE REMAINED IN THE DISTAL RCA. TIMI 3 FLOW WAS ACHIEVED. MEDICATION: HEPARIN AND REOPRO. PLAVIX WAS PRESCRIBED. THREE DAYS LATER A 2.75X12MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE 80% STENOSED PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX, INFLATED TO 14ATM. THE LESION WAS NOT PREDILATED. THE STENOSIS WAS REDUCED TO 0% AND TIMI 3 FLOW WAS PRESENT. MEDICATION: ANGIOMAX AND HEPARIN. THIRTEEN MONTHS POST THE INITIAL STENT IMPLANT, THE PT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. ANGIOGRAPHY IDENTIFIED A 100% PROXIMAL THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION IN THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY DEPLOYED STENT. AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP AND TEMPORARY PACEMAKER WERE PLACED. DUE TO SEVERE RV DYSFUNCTION AND CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT (CABG) WAS PERFORMED USING A SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT (SVG) TO THE RCA. MEDICATION: ATROPHINE, EPINEPHRINE, REOPRO. SEVENTEEN MONTHS POST THE INITIAL STENTING PROCEDURE, THE PT DEVELOPED A RAPID HEART BEAT AT CARDIAC REHAB. AFTER REVIEWING THE RHYTHM STRIPS, THE PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THE PT HAD EXPERIENCE ATRIAL FLUTTER, WHICH BROKE SPONTANEOUSLY. THE PT ALSO NOTES BILATERAL SHOULD PAIN AND SORENESS IN HIS LEGS AND CALVES. AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WAS NEGATIVE FOR MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AT SUBOPTIMAL HEART RATE RESPONSE. PT WAS TREATED MEDICALLY. UPON FOLLOW-UP WITH THE PHYSICIAN, EIGHT DAYS LATER, THE PT REPORTED HE HAD NOT HAD A RECURRENCE OF CHEST DISCOMFORT, BUT STILL HAS MUSCLE SORENESS. TWENTY ONE MONTHS POST THE INITIAL STENTING PROCEDURE, THE PT REPORTED HAVING OCCASIONAL CHEST DISCOMFORT, WHICH HE HAS ATTRIBUTED TO HIS HIATAL HERNIA. THE PT HAS NOT EXPERIENCE ANY FURTHER PALPITATIONS. PT CONTINUES TO BE TREATED MEDICALLY. TWO YEARS AND ONE MONTH POST THE INITIAL STENTING PROCEDURE, THE PT REPORTED HAVING RARE EPISODE OF CHEST DISCOMFORT/PRESSURE, WHICH TENDS TO OCCUR WITH MOVEMENT.

TEN DAYS LATER, ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED 75% STENOSIS IN THE MID CIRCUMFLEX (CX) AND A 100% STENOSED POSTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (PDA). INTERVENTION WAS ATTEMPTED ON PDA WITH NON-BSC DEVICES, HOWEVER, THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THE CHRONICALLY OCCLUDED LESION. THE PHYSICIAN THEN PLACED A 2.50X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT IN THE CX. THE STENT WAS POST DILATED WITH A 2.75X12 QUANTUM BALLOON. THE 75% STENOSIS WAS REDUCED TO 0%.
