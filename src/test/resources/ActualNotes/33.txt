CLINICAL STUDY. SAME CASE AS 6000089-2006-01490. IT WAS REPORTED THAT 96 DAYS AFTER A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE THE PT HAD A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI), STENT THROMBOSIS (ST) AND EXPIRED. THE 1ST LESION BEING TREATED IN THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS A 4.0X6MM, 72% STENOSED, OSTIAL LESION LOCATED IN THE LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY (LMCA) WITH MILD VESSEL TORTUOUSITY AND MODERATE CALCIFICATION PRESENT. THE PHYSICIAN TREATED THE TARGET LESION WITH SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT OF A TAXUS LIBERTE' 3.00X12MM DRUG ELUTING STENT. POST-PROCEDURE TARGET LESION HAD 6% DIAMETER STENOSIS. THE 2ND LESION BEING TREATED IN THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS A 3.5X25MM, 87% IN-STENT STENOSED LESINO LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (PROX LAD) WITH MODERATE VESSEL TORTUOSITY AND MODERATE CALCIFICATIONS PRESENT. THE PHYSICIAN TREATED THE LESION WITH PREDILATION AND SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT OF A TAXUS LIBERTE' 3.50X32MM DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE TARGET LESION. POST-PROCEDURE TARGET LESION HAD 6% DIAMETER STENOSIS. THERE WERE NO REPORTED COMPLICATIONS. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED 2 DAYS LATER ON ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX. AT 96 DAYS AFTER THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE THE PT HAD A MI OF UNK TYPE. ECG WAS NOT PERFORMED AND CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE NOT DRAWN. THE PT ALSO HAD ST IN THE LMCA. NO TREATMENT WAS PERFORMED. THE PT EXPIRED ON THE SAME DAY. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS POSSIBLY MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND CHEST PAIN, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MI, ST AND DEATH TO THE TAXUS LIBERTE' STENT WAS POSSIBLY. THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY OUS APPROVED, BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO A MARKETED US DEVICE.
