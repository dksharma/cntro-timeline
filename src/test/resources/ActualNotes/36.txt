AT THE TIME OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE INDEX PROCEDURE IDENTIFIED LESIONS IN THE CIRCUMFLEX (CX) AND LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERIES. THE FIRST LESION TREATED WAS THE PROXIMAL CX, IT WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED. THE PHYSICIAN PRE-DILATED WITH A 2.50MM MAVERICK BALLOON. THE PHYSICIAN DEPLOYED A TAXUS EXPRESS2 2.75X24MM STENT AT 15ATMS. THE PHYSICIAN POST DILATED WITH A 3.50MM POWERSAIL BALLOON. THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCEDURE WERE TIMI-3 FLOW AND 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. EIGHT DAYS LATER, THE PT WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE CATH LAB TO TREAT THE LAD LESION. THE PHYSICIAN PRE-DILATED THE 70% STENOTIC LAD LESION BY PRE-DILATING WITH A 2.50X20MM QUANTUM MAVERICK AT 10ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS. A FLEXI-CUTTTER WAS USED IN THE LAD AND 1ST DIAGONAL. THE PHYSICIAN DEPLOYED A TAXUS EXPRESS2 2.75X32MM STENT IN THE LAD AT 9ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS. THE STENT WAS POST DILATED WITH A 2.75MM QUANTUM MAVERICK TWICE AT 15ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS EACH. THERE WAS 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS FOLLOWING THE PLACEMENT OF THIS STENT. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED ON PLAVIX AND ASPIRIN. AT 511 DAYS FOLLOWING THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT DEVELOPED SEVERE CHEST PAIN WHILE DRIVING. HE RETURNED HOME AND PHONED EMS. EN ROUTE TO THE HOSP, AN ECG SHOWED A LATERAL AND POSTERIOR INFARCTION. UPON ARRIVAL TO THE CATH LAB, THE PT DEVELOPED PROGRESSIVELY DECREASING BLOOD PRESSURE AND CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP) WAS INSERTED FOLLOWED BY A SWAN-GANZ CATHETER. THE PT BECAME COMBATIVE AND SHORT OF BREATH, SO HE WAS INTUBATED AND ANESTHESIA WAS REQUESTED. AN ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED THAT THE STENTS IMPLANTED IN THE LAD AND CX WERE COMPLETELY OCCLUDED. A 2.50X20MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS INFLATED MULTIPLE TIMES TO 4ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS EACH IN THE LAD. THIS WAS FOLLOWED WITH MULTIPLE ASPIRATIONS WITH A DRIVER CATHETER. THE PT WAS GIVEN 400MG OF VERAPAMIL. TIMI-2 FLOW WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE LAD. THE PHYSICIAN TREATED THE CX WITH A 2.50X20MM MAVERICK BALLOON WHICH ESTABLISHED TIMI-1 FLOW. THE PT'S BLOOD PRESSURE CONTINUED TO DROP, CPR WAS PERFORMED. MULTIPLE DOSES OF EPINEPHRINE, BICARBONATE AND CALCIUM WERE GIVEN. A TEMPORARY PACING WIRE WAS INSERTED IN PLACE OF THE SWAN-GANZ CATHETER AS THE PT BECAME BRADYCARDIC. THE PT EXPIRED LATER THAT DAY. THE CAUSE OF DEATH PER THE INVESTIGATOR WAS CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PT HAD STOPPED PLAVIX ONE YR FOLLOWING THE INDEX PROCEDURE. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THIS EVENT TO THE STUDY DEVICES PER THE PHYSICIAN IS "UNRELATED".
