SAME CASE AS MFR REPORT #: 6000089-2006-02092. CLINICAL TRIAL. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT EXPIRED 106 DAYS FOLLOWING A CORONARY ARTERY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE. THE INDEX PROCEDURE IDENTIFIED AND TREATED 1 LONG, 3X30MM, 80% STENOSED, MODERATELY CALCIFIED, MODERATELY TORTUOUS, DE NOVO, 'Y' BIFURCATED LESION OF THE PROXIMAL TO MID LAD (LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING). THE LESION WAS PREDILATED USING A 2.5X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON AND 2 TAXUS LIBERTE DRUG ELUTING STENTS WERE DEPLOYED IN AN OVERLAPPING FASHION, A 2.75X20MM STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 15ATM IN THE DISTAL PORTION AND A 3X20MM STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 12ATM IN THE PROXIMAL PORTION. THERE WAS A 10% RESIDUAL STENOSIS FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY ON ASA AND PLAVIX. THE PT PRESENTED TO A HOSP OTHER THAN THE STUDY SITE WITH NEPHRITIC SPASMS AND ASA AND PLAVIX WERE DISCONTINUED AS THE PT NEEDED LITHOTRIPSY AND INSERTION OF A URETHRAL "J" CATHETER. ASA AND PLAVIX WERE GIVEN AGAIN FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES, BUT THE PT EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN AND AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) PRIOR TO DISCHARGE. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE MI WAS DUE TO A STENT THROMBOSIS AND THE PT WAS TRANSFERRED FOR PTCA. ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED 100% THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION OF THE LAD AT THE STENT LEVEL. REINTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED WITH ASPIRATIVE THROMBECTOMY AND PLACEMENT OF A CYPHER SELECT STENT WITHIN THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENTS RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. THE PT THEN DEVELOPED NO-REFLOW AND VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION REQUIRING ELECTRICAL DEFIBRILLATION. FOLLOWING DEFIBRILLATION, THE PT DEVELOPED CARDIOGENIC SHOCK WHICH WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT AND THE PT EXPIRED WITHIN 24 HRS OF THE REINTERVENTION. THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY OUS APPROVED BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO A MARKETED US DEVICE.
