IT WAS REPORTED THAT ONE YEAR AND 289 DAYS FOLLOWING A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED A THROMBOSIS AND DIED. BEFORE THE INITIAL PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH AN EVOLVING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) CORONARY ARTERY. RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND A MEDTRONIC 6F 3.75 EBU GUIDE CATHETER WAS ENGAGED IN THE LEFT CORONARY ARTERY. THE LAD WAS CROSSED WITH A 0.014 LUGE GUIDE WIRE AND WAS PREDILATED USING A 2.5X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON INFLATED 8 TIMES TO 10 ATMOSPHERES FOR 30 SECONDS PER INFLATION. THEN A 2.75X28MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT INFLATED TO 10 ATM FOR 40 SECONDS WAS IMPLANTED IN THE OSTIUM OF THE LAD. AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP CATHETER WAS PLACED VIA THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY TO IMPROVE CORONARY BLOOD FLOW DOWN THE LAD AND PROMOTE AFTERLOAD REDUCTION TO IMPROVE LEFT HEART MECHANICS. THE PATIENT RECEIVED VERAPAMIL, HEPARIN AND REOPRO DURING THE PROCEDURE. POST PROCEDURE HEPARIN AND REOPRO WERE CONTINUTED AND PLAVIX WAS TO BE STARTED. POST STENTING CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED A WIDELY PATENT LAD WITH IMPROVED TIMI III FLOW. THERE WERE NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS.  ONE YEAR AND 289 DAYS FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN. THE PATIENT WAS FOUND TO HAVE AN EVOLVING ACUTE INFARCTION AND WAS IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCK WITH HYPOTENSION, EPISODES OF VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA AND BRADYCARDIA REQUIRING AGGRESSIVE INTRAVENOUS MEDICATION. THE PATIENT WAS INTUBATED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND EMERGENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LAB. WHILE ON THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION TABLE CPR WAS INITIATED. DUE TO THE PATIENT'S PROFOUND BRADYCARDIA, A TEMPORARY PACEMAKER WAS PLACED BUT WAS UNABLE TO CAPTURE. CPR WAS CONTINUED. A 6FR ARTERIAL SHEATH WAS PLACED AND A MEDTRONIC EBU WAS ADVANCED TO THE LEFT MAIN (LM) ARTERY. ANGIOGRAM DEMONSTRATED A TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE DISTAL LM WITH NO ANTEGRADE FILLING  INTO THE LAD AND CIRCUMFLEX (CX). A LUGE GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED INTO THE LAD. THE DISTAL AND MID PORTIONS OF THE LM WERE DILATED USING A 2.5X50MM MAVERICK BALLOON, HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THERE WAS INCOMPLETE ANTEGRADE FILLING DUE TO SLOW FLOW. DUE TO THE ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDING, AS WELL AS CONTINUED TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE CX AND PERSISTENT ASYSTOLE, THE RESUSCITATION EFFORTS WERE ENDED AND THE  PATIENT DIED. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE MORGUE.
