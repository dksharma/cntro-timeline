"IN 2003, A PT WAS ADMITTED FOR CORONARY STENTING. THE FIRST DIAGNONAL ARTERY WAS PREDILATED TO 17ATM, AND THE LAD TO 18ATM. THE PT HAD A 3X33MM CYPHER IMPLANTED IN THE LAD, AND A 2.5X18MM CYPHER IMPLANTED IN THE FIRST DIAGONAL ARTERY. THE DIAGONAL ARTERY HAD BEEN JAILED ON THIS PROCEDURE. ONE MONTH GO, THE PT HAD AN IN-STENT RESTENOSIS OF THE CYPHER IN THE FIRST DIAGONAL ARTERY, FOR WHICH A 2.5X18MM CYPHER WAS PLACED AS TREATMENT. THE SITE WAS PREDILATED WITH A 1.5X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON, AND AGAIN WITH A 2.75X15MM QUANTUM MAVERICK BALLOON. THE SITE WAS POSTDILATED WITH THE SAME QUANTUM MAVERICK BALLOON. TWO MONTHS LATER, THE PT RETURNED WITH THROMBOSIS IN THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE CYPHER IN THE LAD. AFTER MULTIPLE DILATATIONS, AN ABBOTT STENT WAS PLACED. REOPRO WAS USED, AND THE CLOT STARTED TO BREAK UP. THE PT WAS PLACED ON A BALLOON PUMP AND VENTILATOR AFTERWARD. PER REPORTER, THE FAMILY DECIDED TO WITHDRAW LIFE SUPPORT POST RECOVERY, DUE TO THE PT'S MULTIPLE MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE PT DIED THE NEXT DAY.
