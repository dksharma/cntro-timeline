A PT WENT INTO CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSP AS AN EMERGENCY. CORONARY ANGIOGRAM (CAG) REVEALED A THROMBOSIS AT AN IMPLANTED CYPHER AT LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY. TO TREAT THE THROMBUS, AN INTRA -AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP) WAS INSERTED, AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS CONDUCTED USING KISSING BALLOON TECHNIQUE (KBT). THEN ASPIRATION WAS DONE. BUT THE PT DID NOT RECOVER. THE PT DIED THE FOLLOWING DAY. ACCORDING TO THE PHYSICIAN THE THROMBOTIC EVENT IS THE RESULT OF A STRUTS IN THE LEFT MAIN TRUNK DUE TO KISSING STENTS AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS HEART FAILURE. THE PT HAS A HISTORY OF TWO CYPHER STENTS IMPLANTED BY KISSING TECHNIQUE THAT TARGETED A TYPE C DE-NOVO, ECCENTRIC, BIFURCATED LESION AT THE LEFT MAIN TRUNK WITH A LENGTH OF 10MM AND A DIAMETER OF 4MM. DURING THIS ELECTIVE PROCEDURE, PRE-DILATATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH A BALLOON (3.0/20MM) AT 12ATM FOR 60 SECONDS. THE 1ST CYPHER (3.0/18MM) WAS IMPLANTED AT 16ATM FOR 20 SECONDS AT THE LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY (LMT-LAD), THE 2ND CYPHER (2.5/18MM) WAS IMPLANTED AT 16ATM FOR 20 SECONDS AT THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY (LMT-LCX). THE TWO STENTS WERE IMPLANTED BY KISSING-STENT TECHNIQUE. POST-DILATION WAS CONDUCTED BY KISSING BALLOON TECHNIQUE (KBT) WITH THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM'S BALLOONS. INFLATION TIME AND PRESSURE WERE UNK. INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) WAS CONDUCTED. THE RESIDUAL PERCENTAGE OF STENOSIS WAS ZERO. TIMI FLOW BEFORE THE PROCEDURE WAS 3 AND 3 AFTER THE PROCEDURE. ACTIVATED CLOTTING TIME WAS NOT MEASURED. DISTAL TO THE IMPLANTED TARGET LESION, THERE WERE TWO OTHER STENTS, A SENPU (3.0/30MM) STENT IMPLANTED APPROX EIGHT MONTHS EARLIER IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING BRANCH AND AN S670 (3.0/15MM) BRANCH. ABOUT 4 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT, A FOLLOW-UP CAG WAS CONDUCTED BUT THERE WAS NO ISSUE.
