AS REPORTED BY THE STUDY, THIS PATIENT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DRUG ELUTING ARM OF THE STUDY IN DECEMBER, 2004. THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH2-VESSEL DISEASE IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) AND IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) WAS PERFORMED ON A 65% STENOSED LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LAD OF 9.64MM IN THE LENGTH  IN A 3.17MM VESSEL DIAMETER. THERE WAS NO CALCIFICATION OR THROMBUS PRESENT. DIRECT STENTING WAS PERFORMED WITH A 3.5X18MM CYPER SELECT STENT AT UNK INFLATION PRESSURE. THERE WAS NO DISSECTION OR POST-DILATION. TIMI III FLOWS WERE RECORDED PRE AND POST-PROCEDURE. INTRA-PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASPIRIN, CLOPIDOGREL AND HEPARIN (5000 U). ALMOST SIX MONTHS LATER, THE PATIENT RETURNED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFRACTION. AN OSTIAL LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LAD WAS TREATED WITH A 3.0X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. A NEW LESION IN THE DISTAL LAD WAS TREATED WITH A 2.5X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. IN ADDITION, A 70% STENOSED LESION IN THE OBTUSE MARGINAL WAS TREATED WITH A 2.5X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. FINALLY, A 70%  STENOSED LESION IN PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS TREATED WITH A NON-CYPHER STENT. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT WEEKS LATER, THE PATIENT RETURNED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA, BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA. THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED AND THROMBUS WAS PRESENT. IT WAS TREATED WITH AN UNK CIPHER STENT. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED WITHOUT HIS PHYSICIAN'S CONSENT IN NOVEMBER, 2005, IN PRE-TERMINAL STATUS. THE DEATH WAS INDICATED AS A CARDIAC DEATH. THE CAUSE WAS THROMBOSIS, INTRASTENT, OTHER VESSEL. CLARIFICATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED REGARDING THE PROCEDURES AND THE DEATH, BUT HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE US DISTRIBUTED CYPHER SIROLIMUS DRUG ELUTING STENT. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION BY THE STUDY. A MALE PATIENT WITH A HISTORY OF DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, SMOKING, PREVIOUS MI AND STABLE ANGINA EXPERIENCED RESTENOSIS, TWO AMIS, CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, A THROMBOTIC EVENT AND EXPIRED POST CYPHER STENT IMPLANTATIONS. THE REASON FOR THE PATIENT'S INITIAL ADMISSION TO HOSP WAS NOT REPORTED; BUT AN ANGIOGRAM REVEALED LESIONS IN HIS PROXIMAL LAD AND PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. THE PATIENT'S HISTORY PUTS HIM AT INCREASED RISK FOR MACE. PRE PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASA; WHILE INTRA PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASA, PLAVIX AND HEPARIN. THE INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. THE LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS 65% OCCLUDED, 3.17MM IN DIAMETER, 9.64MM IN LENGTH, UN-CALCIFIED AND WITH NO PRE-EXISTING THROMBUS PRESENT. THE LESION WAS NOT PRE-DILATED PRIOR TO THE PLACEMENT OF A 3.50 X 18MM CYPHER SELECT AT AN UNK MAXIMUM INFLATION PRESSURE. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A RESULTANT TIMI FLOW OF 3 AND A RESIDUAL STENOSIS OF 19.3%. THE 100% PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX LESION DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED DURING THIS PROCEDURE. THE POST PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA OR PLAVIX WAS NOT REPORTED. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS RE-ADMITTED WITH AN AMI. A REPEAT ANGIOGRAM PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY REVEALED A STENOSIS IN THE OSTIUM OF THE LAD, PROXIMAL TO THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED CYPHER SELECT STENT. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS NEW LESION WAS WITHIN 5MM OF THE PREVIOUS STENT. IN ADDITION, A 70% OCCLUSION IN THE FIRST OMB AND A 70% OCCLUSION IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. THE PRE OR INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA, PLAVIX, HEPARIN OR GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. NO VESSEL AND/OR LESION CHARACTERISTICS WERE PROVIDED. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF ANY OF THE LESIONS WERE PRE-DILATED. A 2.50 X 33MM CYPHER SELECT STENT WAS PLACED IN THE OMB; A 3.00 X 23MM PROXIMAL TO AND OVERLAPPING THE ORIGINAL CYPHER STENT, A 2.5 X 23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT DISTAL TO AND OVERLAPPING THE ORIGINAL CYPHER SELECT STENT AND A NON-CORDIS DES IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. ACCORDING TO THE IFU, THE USE OF MORE THAN TWO CYPHER SELECT STENTS HAS NOT BEEN CLINICALLY STUDIED. THE POST PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA OR PLAVIX WAS NOT REPORTED. THE PT IS REPORTED TO HAVE RECOVERED FROM HIS MI. NINE MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND THREE MONTHS AFTER THE LATEST ONE, THE PT WAS ADMITTED WITH STEMI, CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, PULMONARY EDEMA, BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA. A REPEAT ANGIOGRAM REVEALED THROMBUS COMPLETELY OCCLUDING THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. NO NEW SIGNIFICANT LESIONS WERE NOTED. THE PRE OR INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA, PLAVIX, HEPARIN OR GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. NO VESSELS AND/OR LESION CHARACTERISTICS WERE PROVIDED. THE THROMBUS WAS TREATED WITH PRE-DILATION AND THE PLACEMENT OF AN UNK CYPHER SELECT STENT. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A RESULTANT TIMI FLOW OF 3. LATER THAT SAME EVENING, THE PT SIGNED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOSP AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE AND EXPIRED TWO DAYS LATER. IT IS UNK IF THE PT RETURNED TO THE HOSP OR IF HE DIED AT HOME. THE DEATH WAS REPORTED TO BE OF CARDIAC CAUSE AND RELATED TO AN INTRA-STENT THROMBOTIC EVENT. NO ACTUAL CAUSE OF DEATH WAS REPORTED. IT IS UNK WHETHER THIS THROMBOSIS WAS ASSUMMED OR WHETHER IT WAS CONFIRMED WITH AN ANGIOGRAM OR UPON AUTOPSY. ADD'L INFO REGARDING THESE EVENTS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE PRODUCTS REMAIN IN THE PT AND ARE THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVAL. RESTENOSIS AND THROMBOSIS ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. IN ADDITION, RESTENOSIS IS ALSO OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESSION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY INVESTIGATOR, THE BRONCHITIS, PNEUMONIA, SECOND AMI, WAS NOT RELATED TOTHE CYPHER PRODUCTS. WITHOUT FURTHER INFO OR THE DEFINITIVE FINDINGS OF AN ANGIOGRAM OR AUTOPSY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW A CONCLUSION ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE DEVICESS AND THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE PT, VESSEL AND PROCEDURAL [MORE]
