IT WAS REPORTED THAT 1 YR 7 DAYS POST, A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THROMBOSIS AND DEATH OCCURRED. THE LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE UNPROTECTED LEFT MAIN (LM) AND WAS APPROX 80% STENOSED. THE PHYSICIAN ADVANCED THE WIRE INTO THE DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD), AND THEN ADVANCED A 2.5X9MM BALLOON OF UNK TYPE TO THE AREA OF THE LESION IN THE LM. IT WAS INFLATED TO 10 ATMS FOR 10 SECS. THE BALLOON WAS REMOVED AND A 3.0X8MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS ADVANCED TO THE AREA OF THE LESION. IT WAS DEPLOYED TO APPROX 10 ATMS FOR 10 SECS. FOLLOWING THIS, REPEAT CINEANGIOGRAM SHOWED THE ARTERY TO BE WIDELY PATENT WITH NO DISSECTION OR THROMBUS AND TIMI 3 FLOW. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS. ONE YR AND 7 DAYS LATER, THE PT UNDERWENT BACK SURGERY. HE HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF HIS PLAVIX 7 DAYS PRIOR TO THE SURGERY. THE PT DID WELL POSTOPERATIVELY, BUT THEN DEVELOPED SUBSTERNAL CHEST PAIN. EKG SHOWED AN ANTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND A STAT ECHO SHOWED HYPOKINESIS OF THE ANTERIOR WALL. CINEANGIOGRAMS SHOWED THAT THE PT HAD A 100% THROMBOSIS IN HIS LM. A WIRE WAS ADVANCED INTO THE DISTAL LAD AND A 2.5X15MM MAVERICK BALLOON WAS ADVANCED TO THE AREA OF THE STENOSIS AND INFLATED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOW. THE PT'S "ST'S IMPROVED," BUT SOON THEREAFTER, THE PT BECAME DYSPNEIC. HIS SATURATIONS BEGAN TO DROP AND HE WENT INTO PULMONARY EDEMA. ANESTHESIOLOGY CAME AND TRIED TO INTUBATE THE PT, HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMATIC AIRWAY FROM HIS PREVIOUS INTUBATION, IT WAS QUITE EDEMATOUS AND IT WAS UNABLE TO BE PERFORMED. THE PT THEN BECAME BRADYCARDIC AND HYPOTENSIVE. CPR WAS COMMENCED IMMEDIATELY. THE PT WAS GIVEN CARDIOACTIVE DRUGS SUCH AS EPINEPHRINE, ATROPINE, AND BICARB MULTIPLE TIMES. HE RE-ESTABLISHED A BLOOD PRESSURE FOR A FAIRLY REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, HOWEVER, DURING THIS TIME, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO OXYGENATE THE PT. CODE BLUE WAS CALLED AND INTUBATION WAS ATTEMPTED AGAIN, WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE PT BECAME STEADILY MORE HYPOXIC DURING THAT TIME. A PHYSICIAN THEN DID AN EMERGENCY TRACHEOTOMY, BUT BECAUSE OF THE SECRETIONS THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO OXYGENATE THE PT. AS A RESULT OF THIS PROLONGED HYPOXIA, THE PT AGAIN BECAME BRADYCARDIC AND HYPOTENSIVE. FURTHER EPINEPHRINE AND ATROPINE WERE GIVEN, BUT THE PT DID NOT RESPOND. BECAUSE OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE, THE PT PASSED AWAY. FURTHER INFO HAS BEEN REQUESTED BUT HAS NOT BEEN REC'D.
