AS REPORTED BY THE STUDY, THIS PT WAS INCLUDED IN THE DRUG ELUTING ARM OF THE STUDY IN 2004. THE PT PRESENTED WITH 2-VESSEL DISEASE IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) AND IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) WAS PERFORMED ON A 65% STENOSED LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LAD OF 9.64MM IN LENGTH IN A 3.17MM VESSEL DIAMETER. THERE WAS NO CALCIFICATION OR THROMBUS PRESENT. DIRECT STENTING WAS PERFORMED WITH A 3.5X18MM CYPHER SELECT STENT AT UNK INFLATION PRESSURE. THERE WAS NO DISSECTION OR POST-DILATION. TIMI III FLOWS WERE RECORDED PRE AND POST-PROCEDURE. INTRA-PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASPIRIN, CLOPIDOGREL AND HEPARIN (5000 U). ALMOST 6 MONTHS LATER, THE PT RETURNED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. AN OSTIAL LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LAD WAS TREATED WITH A 3.0X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. A NEW LESION IN THE DISTAL LAD WAS TREATED WITH A 2.5X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. IN ADDITION, A 70% STENOSED LESION IN THE OBTUSE MARGINAL WAS TREATED WITH A 2.5X33MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. FINALLY, A 70% STENOSED LESION IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS TREATED WITH A NON- CYPHER STENT. APPROX 8 WEEKS LATER, THE PT RETURNED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE PULMONARY EDEMA, BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA. THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS TOTALLY OCCLUDED AND THROMBUS WAS PRESENT. IT WAS TREATED WITH A 3.5X23MM UNK CYPHER STENT. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED WITHOUT HIS PHYSICIAN'S CONSENT 2 DAYS LATER, IN PRE-TERMINAL STATUS. THE DEATH WAS INDICATED AS A CARDIAC DEATH. THE CAUSE WAS THROMBOSIS, INTRASTENT, OTHER VESSEL. AN AUTOPSY WAS NOT PERFORMED. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE US DISTRIBUTED. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION BY THE DESSERT STUDY. A 74 YR OLD MALE PT WITH A HISTORY OF DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, SMOKING, PREVIOUS MI AND STABLE ANGINA EXPERIENCED RESTENOSIS, 2 AMIS, CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, A THROMBOTIC EVENT AND EXPIRED POST CYPHER STENT IMPLANTATIONS. THE REASON FOR THE PT'S INITIAL ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL WAS NOT REPORTED; BUT AN ANGIOGRAM REVEALED LESIONS IN HIS PROXIMAL LAD AND PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. THIS PT'S HISTORY PUTS HIM AT INCREASED RISK FOR MACE. PRE PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASA; WHILE INTRA PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASA, PLAVIX AND HEPARIN. THE INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING AF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. THE LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS 65% OCCLUDED, 3.17MM IN DIAMETER, 9.64MM IN LENGTH, UN-CALCIFIED AND WITH NO PRE-EXISTING THROMBUS PRESENT. THE LESION WAS NOT PRE-DILATED PRIOR TO THE PLACEMENT OF A 3.50X18MM CYPHER SELECT STENT AT AN UNK MAX INFLATION PRESSURE. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A RESULTANT TIMI FLOW OF 3 AND A RESIDUAL STENOSIS OF 19.3%. THE 100% PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX LESION DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED DURING THIS PROCEDURE. THE POST PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA OR PLAVIX WAS NOT REPORTED. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT DEVELOPED ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES AND RULED IN WITH AN AMI. A REPEAT ANGIOGRAM PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY REVEALED A STENOSIS IN THE OSTIUM OF THE LAD, PROXIMAL TO THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED CYPHER SELECT STENT. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS NEW LESION WAS WITHIN 5 MM OF THE PREVIOUS STENT. IN ADDITION, A 70% OCCLUSION IN THE FIRST OMB AND A 70% OCCLUSION IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. THE PRE OR INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA, PLAVIX, HEPARIN OR GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. NO VESSEL AND/OR LESION CHARACTERISTICS WERE PROVIDED. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF ANY OF THE LESIONS WERE PRE-DILATED. A 2.50X33MM CYPHER SELECT STENT WAS PLACED IN THE OMB; A 3.00X23MM PROXIMAL TO AND OVERLAPPING THE ORIGINAL CYPHER SELECT STENT, A 2.5X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT DISTAL TO AND OVERLAPPING THE ORIGINAL CYPHER SELECT STENT AND A NON-CORDIS DES IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. ACCORDING TO THE IFU, THE USE OF MORE THAN 2 CYPHER SELECT STENTS HAS NOT BEEN CLINICALLY STUDIED. THE POST PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA OR PLAVIX WAS NOT REPORTED. THE PT IS REPORTED TO HAVE RECOVERED FROM HIS MI. NINE MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE LATEST ONE, THE PT WAS ADMITTED WITH ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES AND RULED IN WITH A STEMI. IN ADDITION, HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE DEVELOPED CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, PULMONARY EDEMA, BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA. A REPEAT ANGIOGRAM REVEALED THROMBUS COMPLETELY OCCLUDING THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX AT THE SITE OF A NON-CORDIS BMS. NO NEW SIGNIFICANT LESIONS WERE NOTED. THE PRE OR INTRA PROCEDURAL ADMINISTRATION OF ASA, PLAVIX, HEPARIN OR GPIIBIIIA AND THE PERFORMANCE OR RECORDING OF ACTS WAS NOT REPORTED. NO VESSELS AND/OR LESION CHARACTERISTICS WERE PROVIDED. THE THROMBUS WAS TREATED WITH PRE-DILATION AND THE PLACEMENT OF A 3.50X23MM CYPHER SELECT STENT. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A RESULTANT TIMI FLOW OF 3. LATER THAT SAME EVENING, THE PT SIGNED HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE AND EXPIRED 2 DAYS LATER. IT APPEARS THAT THE PT HAD BEEN RE-ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS REPORTED TO BE OF CARDIO-PULMONARY ARREST AND RELATED TO AN INTRA-STENT THROMBOTIC EVENT. NO AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS THROMBOSIS WAS ASSUMED OR WHETHER IT WAS CONFIRMED WITH AN ANGIOGRAM. THE PRODUCTS REMAIN IMPLANTED IN THE PT AND ARE THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A DHR REVIEW FOR THE PRODUCT REVEALED THAT THE PRODUCT MET REQUIREMENTS FOR PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE. DHR REVIEWS FOR THE REMAINING PRODUCTS COULD NOT BE PERFORMED SINCE THE LOT NUMBERS WERE NOT PROVIDED. RESTENOSIS AND THROMBOSIS ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. IN ADDITION, RESTENOSIS IS ALSO OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESSION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. ACCORDING TO THE STUDY INVESTIGATOR, THE BRONCHITIS, PNEUMONIA, SECOND AMI, WAS NOT RELATED TO THE CYPHER PRODUCTS. WITHOUT FURTHER INFORMATION OR THE DEFINITIVE FINDINGS OF AN ANGIOGRAM OR AUTOPSY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW A CONCLUSION ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE DEVICES AND THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE PT, VESSEL AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THEM. THIS IS 1 OF 5 PRODUCTS USED IN THE SAME PROCEDURE THAT WE SUBMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING MANUFACTURING NUMBERS 9616099-2007-00058, 9616099-2007-00059, 9616099-2007-00060, 9616099-2007-00061 AND 9616099-2007-01554.
