THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS AN ELECTIVE CASE. THE TARGET LESION FOR THE PROCEDURE WAS THE PROXIMAL/MID LAD. THE LESION WAS REPORTED TO BE: DE NOVO, A CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION (CTO), 50 MM IN LENGTH, VESSEL DIAMETER OF 2.5 MM AND TYPE C. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A 1.5 X 15 MM BALLOON AT 10 ATM FOR 30 SEC AND A 2.5 X 20 MM BALLOON AT 6 ATM FOR 30 SEC. A CYPHER 2.5X 28 MM STENT (STENT #1) WAS IMPLANTED AT 16 ATM FOR 30 SEC. AN ADDITIONAL CYPHER 3.0 X 33 MM (STENT #2) WAS IMPLANTED AT 16 ATM FOR 30 SEC IN OVERLAPPING FASHION. THE STENTS WERE POST-DILATED WITH A 4.5 X 13 MM BALLOON AT 14 ATM FOR 10 SEC AND A 4.0 X 18 MM BALLOON AT 16 ATM FOR 20 SEC. IVUS WAS DONE. THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. THE FLOW PRE-PROCEDURE WAS TIMI 0 AND POST-PROCEDURE TIMI 3. AN ACT WAS NOT MEASURED. PLEASE NOTE THAT DEVICE (LOT # I0605045) IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING. A REPORT WAS RECEIVED INDICATING TWO CYPHER STENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS. THE EVENT INVOLVED A MALE WITH A HISTORY OF DIABETES. THIS PATIENT'S HISTORY PLACES HIM AT INCREASED RISK OF MACE. THE INDICATION FOR INITIAL ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL IS NOT KNOWN. AN ELECTIVE CORONARY ARTERIOGRAM REVEALED A 50MM, DE NOVO, CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION CLASSIFIED AS TYPE C IN THE PROXIMAL AND MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY. THE REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.5MM. ACCORDING TO THE IFU, CYPHER IS NOT INDICATED FOR USE IN LESIONS GREATER THAN 30M IN LENGTH. THE LESION WAS TREATED WITH PRE-DILATION FOLLOWED BY IMPLANTATION OF 2.50X 28MM CYPHER STENT AT 16 ATM. AND AN OVERLAPPING 3.00 X 33MM CYPHER STENT AT 16 ATM. POST-DILATION AND INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND WERE CONDUCTED. THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0% AND TIMI FLOW INCREASED FROM 0 TO 3 FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. PRE AND INTRA-PROCEDURAL MEDICATIONS WERE NOT SPECIFIED, HOWEVER, IT WAS DOCUMENTED THE PATIENT RECEIVED ASA, TICLID AND HEPARIN THE DAY OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND WAS DISCHARGED ON ASA AND TICLID. THE TICLID HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH PLETAL TEN DAYS FOLLOWING THE INDEX PROCEDURE DUE TO AN UNSPECIFIED REACTION TO THE TICLID. THE PLETAL WAS DISCONTINUED NINETEEN MONTHS FOLLOWING THE INDEX PROCEDURE AS THE PATIENT "REMAINED IN STABLE CONDITION AT FOLLOW-UP". TWENTY-FIVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE INDEX PROCEDURE THE PT EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN AND CARDIO-PULMONARY ARREST. CPR WAS PERFORMED AND THE PATIENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESUSCITATED. A REPEAT CORONARY ANGIOGRAM WAS CONDUCTED REVEALING THROMBUS INSIDE THE CYPHER STENTS IMPLANTED IN THE LAD. ADDITIONALLY, A THROMBUS WAS PRESENT IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. ASPIRATION AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WERE PERFORMED, HOWEVER, THE FLOW DID NOT RECOVER AND THE PATIENT EXPIRED. AN AUTOPSY WAS NOT CONDUCTED AND THE CYPHER STENTS REMAINED IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. MANUFACTURING RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AND BOTH PRODUCTS MET QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE. THROMBOSIS AND DEATH ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STENT IMPLANTATION. BASED UPON THE INFO PROVIDED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENTS HOWEVER; THERE ARE PATIENT AND LESION FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THEM. THIS IS ONE OF TWO PRODUCTS USED DURING THE SAME PROCEDURE. PLEASE REFERENCE MFR. REPORT #9616099-2007-01958 AND #9616099-2007-01959. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE INITIAL/FINAL REPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT.
