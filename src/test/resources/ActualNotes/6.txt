CLINICAL STUDY. SAME CASE AS MFR # 6000089-2005-00328. IT WAS REPORTED THAT 332 DAYS AFTER A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PT EXPIRED. THE PT WAS ENROLLED INTO THE ARRIVE PROGRAM IN MARCH 2004. TARGET LESION 1 WAS LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL RCA WITH 95% STENOSIS AND WAS 12 MM LONG WITH A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 3.0MM. TARGET LESION 1 WAS TREATED WITH PREDILATATION AND A 3.0X16MM TAXUS STENT, WITH 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. TARGET LESION 2 WAS LOCATED IN THE 1ST OM WITH 100% STENOSIS AND WAS 18 MM LONG WITH A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 2.5MM. TARGET LESION 2 WAS TREATED WITH PREDILATATON AND A 2.5X24MM TAXUS STENT, WITH 10% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. POST ARRIVE PROCEDURE, CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE ELEVATED CDONSISTENT WITH GUIDELINE DEFINITION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. PER SOURCE DOCUMENTS, ENZYME ELEVATION WAS THROUGH TO BE SECONDARY TO REPERFUSION INJURY. PT ALSO UNDERWENT AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY CONSULT (DATE UNKNOWN) FOR MULTIPLE RUNS OF NON-SUSTAINED VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAC. NO INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED; RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE FOR FOLLOW-UP ECHOCARDIOGRAM IN 3 MONTHS WITH POSSIBLE ICD IMPLANTATION IF EJECTION FRACTION NOTED LESS THAN 30%. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED TO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY 10/MAR/2004 ON ASA AND PLAVIX THERAPY. IN 2005, PT WAS ADMITTED FOR EVALUATION OF DECREASING MENTAL STASTUS AND LETHARGY. PER SOURCE DOCUMENTS, PT WAS NOW A RESIDENT OF AN EXTENDED CARE FACILITY. ECG INDICATED SINUS RHYTHM WAS NEW ST SEGMENT ELEVAUATIONS IN LEADS III, V2, AND V3;L CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE ELESVATED CONSISTENT WITH GUIDELINE DEFINITION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. COORNARY ANGIOGRPAHY WAS NOT PERFORMED PER REQUEST OF PT AND FAMILY FOR COMFORT MEASURES ONLY. THE SITE REPORTS PRESUMED STENT THROMBOSIS BASED ON GUIDELINE DEFINITION OF A NON-ANGIOGRAPHICALLY CONFIRMED STENT THROMBOSIS: "ACUTE MI IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TARGET VESSEL." THE INTERIM DIAGNOSES OF ACUTE MI AND POSSIBLE SEPSIS (DUE TO A COMBINATION OF URINARY TRACT INFECTION, RECENT C. DIFFICILE INFECTION, AND/OR FOOT ULCERS) WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PT AND FAMILY; CODE STATUS WAS AGREED UPON. THE PT EXPIRED SAME DAY @ 21:55. AN AUTOPSY WAS NOT PERFORMED.
