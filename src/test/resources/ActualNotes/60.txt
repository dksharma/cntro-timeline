SAME CASE AS MFR REPORT #6000093-2007-02399. IT WAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A CORONARY ARTERY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, DEATH OCCURRED. THE TARGET LESION CONSISTED OF A 90% STENOSIS IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX) ARTERY, A 75% STENOSIS IN THE DISTAL LCX, AND A 50% STENOSIS IN THE LEFT MAIN TRUNK (LMT). THE PT HAD A 2.75X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT (DES) DEPLOYED IN THE DISTAL LCX AT 16 ATMOSPHERES (ATMS) AND A 3.0X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DES DEPLOYED IN THE PROXIMAL LCX AT 12 ATMS OVERLAPPING THE 2.75X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DES. A PORTION OF THE 3.0X16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DES PROTRUDED INTO THE LMT. A 3.0 NON-BSC BALLOON CATHETER WAS INFLATED 6 TIMES TO A MAX OF 10 ATMS TO FULLY EXPAND THE STENT AND DILATE THE LMT. INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND CONFIRMED THE DEVICES WERE WELL EXPANDED. THE PT WAS GIVEN 8CC OF HEPARIN DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PT WAS NOT DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL FOR UNK REASONS. AT 63 DAYS LATER, SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST OCCURRED AND THROMBOSIS WAS NOTED IN THE LMT TO THE LCX. THE PT'S "HEART STROKE WAS VERY WEAK." AN INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP WAS INSERTED, HOWEVER THE PT DIED "A FEW HRS LATER." THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOSIS IS UNK. THE PT HAD TAKEN ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION AS PRESCRIBED. THE PT'S CHEMOTHERAPY MAY BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PT DEATH TO THE TAXUS STENTS IS UNK. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT "EVEN IF OTHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED, THE SAME EVENT WOULD OCCUR".
