SAME CASE AS MFR #213265-2008-00356. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, STENT THROMBOSIS AND PATIENT DEATH OCCURRED. THE PT PRESENTED IN 2007 WITH CHEST PAIN, AND A 50-99% STENOSIS WAS FOUND IN THE PROXIMAL AND MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LADTHE TARGET ). VESSEL HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT 3-3.5MM. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, THE PHYSICIAN PREDILATED THE LESION WITH AN 2.5MM BALLOON (UNKNOWN TYPE) AT 6 ATMS, AND THEN IMPLANTED A 3.50X28MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT AND A 3.00X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT. THE TWO STENTS WERE OVERLAPPING. THE STENTS WERE CONFIRMED WITH IVUS AND THE CHEST PAIN WAS RESOLVED. THE STENTS WERE WELL POSITIONED AND WELL APPOSED. PENALDINE AND BAYASPIRIN WERE GIVEN BEFORE AND DURING THE PROCEDURE. TWENTY SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PT RETURNED FOR AN ENDOSCOPY OF THE COLON, DURING WHICH NIFLEC WAS USED. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS IN A COLD SWEAT SO IT WAS STOPPED, AND THE MELAENA WAS RESOLVED TO THE PT DIDN'T GO TO GASTROENTEROLOGICAL MEDICINE. FIVE DAYS LATER, THE PT WAS TAKEN OFF OF PANALDINE AND PUT ON PLETAAL BECAUSE OF LEUCOPENIA. THREE MONTHS LATER, CANCER WAS DIAGNOSED IN THE SIGMOID, AND THE NEXT MONTH THE PHYSICIAN OPERATED ON THE SIGMOID. THE PT WAS TAKEN OFF OF ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE AND STARTED ON A HEPARIN DRIP. AFTER RETURNING TO THE ROOM AFTER SURGERY, VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION OCCURRED AND PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS SUPPORT (PCPS) AND AN INTRA AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP) WERE INSERTED TO THE PT. CARDIAC MUSCLE DAMAGE WAS NOTED WITH ECG AND A THROMBOSIS WAS NOTED AT THE DISTAL SIDE OF THE 3.00X20MM TAXUS STENT AND AT THE PROXIMAL SIDE OF THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE THROMBOSIS IN THE LAD WAS ASPIRATED AND THEN DILATED WITH A 2.5MM BALLOON (TYPE UNKNOWN). ANGIOGRAPHY NOTED HAZY IMAGINE, SO PLAIN OLD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED, AND FLOW WAS RESTORED.
