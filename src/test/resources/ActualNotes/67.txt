IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, IN-STENT RESTENOSIS, STENT THROMBOSIS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, CHEST PAIN, AND PATIENT DEATH OCCURRED. THE PT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND A 100% STENOSIS WAS FOUND AT THE LCX. THE PHYSICIAN IMPLANTED A 3.50X32MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE DAYS LATER, FOLLOW UP WAS DONE WITH CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY, AND THROMBOSIS WAS CONFIRMED WITH IN-STENT RESTENOSIS AT THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL LCX. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS WAS FOUND WITHIN THE 3.50X32MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT (70% STENOSIS). THE LESIONS BEING TREATED WERE LOCATED IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) AND IN THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX) ARTERIES. THE PROXIMAL LAD WAS 3.5MM IN A DIAMETER WITH A 70% STENOSIS AND A 1.5MM LENGTH LESION. THE LCX WAS 2.5MM IN DIAMETER WITH A 70% STENOSIS AND A 3.5M LENGTH LESION. BOTH LESIONS WERE CALCIFIED AND BOTH VESSELS WERE TORTUOUS. ONE DAY LATER, THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO PASS THE INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) THROUGH THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL LCX. THE PHYSICIAN PREDILATED THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL LCX WITH AN APEX 2.50X20MM BALLOON AT 12 ATMS FOR 30 SECONDS AND 16 ATMS FOR 15 SECONDS. A GUIDEWIRE WAS INSERTED TO THE PROXIMAL LAD AND THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.50X20MM APEX BALLOON AT 16 ATMS. A 3.50X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS IMPLANTED AT THE PROXIMAL LAD AT 10 ATMS AND WAS POST DILATED WITH THE DELIVERY BALLOON. THE PROXIMAL LCX WAS THEN PREDILATED WITH A 2.50X20MM APEX BALLOON AT 12 ATMS, AND A 2.50X24MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS IMPLANTED AT THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL LCX, AND THEN A 2.50X 16MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS IMPLANTED WITH BOTH STENTS OVERLAPPING THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENTS. IT WAS POST DILATED WITH THE DELIVERY BALLOON. THE FLOW WAS CONFIRMED WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. TWO DAYS LATER, THE PT COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAIN. OVER THE NEXT 6 HRS, THE PT WAS PLACED ON INTRANASAL 3L AND 5L MEDICATION AND HEPARIN. THE PT EXPERIENCED DEPRESSED CONSCIOUSNESS AND HEART MASSAGE WAS DONE. PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS SUPPORT (PCPS) WAS INSERTED. PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED IN THE MID LAD AND THE PROXIMAL LCX. BOTH VESSELS WERE DILATED WITH A 2.5X15MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON, BUT FLOW COULD NOT BE RESTORED. THE PT WITH PCPS WAS TAKEN TO THE ICU WITH A HEART RATE OF 50-60. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PT DIED. THE PHYSICIAN FELT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF DEATH WAS AMI FOR ISR WITH TWO LESIONS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TAXUS STENTS AND THE THROMBOSIS IS UNKNOWN. THE PT WAS REPORTED TO BE COMPLAINT WITH ANTIPLATELET THERAPY (TICLOPIDINE AND ASPIRIN TAKEN SINCE 2007).
