THE REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE CLINICAL STUDY REGISTRY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY,  INDICATED THAT A PT DIED OF LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE, ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE COMPLICATED BY PNEUMONIA FOUR MONTHS AFTER RECEIVING TWO CYPHER STENTS. THE MAIN INDICATION FOR THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS ACUTE INFERIOR WALL NON Q-WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE TARGET VESSEL WAS AN OSTIAL SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT (SVG); NO FURTHER INFO REGARDING THE LESION CHARACTERISTICS WAS PROVIDED. TWO CYPHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED, A 3.5 X 33MM AND A 3.5 X 13MM CYPHERS WERE IMPLANTED. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF PRE AND POST DILATATION WERE CONDUCTED, NO PROCEDURAL COMPLICATION WAS REPORTED AND THE PT WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON ASPIRIN, CLOPIDOGREL STATINS, ACE INHIBITORS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS ADMITTED FOR PLANNED TREATMENT OF A LONG STANDING LUMBER2 TO SACRAL CANAL STENOSIS BY LAMINECTOMY. OF NOTE, ASA AND CLOPIDOGREL WERE DISCONTINUED FOR 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING DAY AFTER SURGERY, THE PT COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAIN AND ALSO DEVELOPED AN INCREASE IN TROPONIN. CORONARY ANGIOGRAM THE NEXT DAY REVEALED IN-STENT THROMBOSIS OF THE SVG WITH 80% TO 90% STENOSIS. THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) ALSO HAD A 90% OCCLUSION BUT WAS NOT TREATED DUE TO SEVERE LEFT VENTRICULAR FUNCTION IMPAIRMENT. BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED ON THE SVG (BY DILATING TO A DIAMETER OF 3.5MM) TO TREAT THE THROMBUS WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS. THE PT WAS RETURNED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WERE THE TROPONIN CONTINUED TO RISE AND THE PT WENT INTO CARDIOGENIC SHOCK REQUIRING INTUBATION. THE PT'S CONDITION CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE AND THE PT DEVELOPED PULMONARY EDEMA, CONTINUED RISE IN TROPONIN AND WORSENING HEART FAILURE WITH PNEUMOTHORAX ON CHEST X-RAY. PT WENT INTO ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND FAILED MEDICAL TREATMENT (WITH AMIODARONE) AND CARDIOVERTED. THE PT REMAINED HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE WITH RENAL FAILURE AND REFRACTIVE CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. THE PT SUBSEQUENTLY DIED FOUR DAYS AFTER ADMISSION FOR LAMINECTOMY.
