TWO MONTHS AFTER A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PT'S PLAVIX WAS STOPPED AND THE PT EXPIRED. IN 2004, THE PHYSICIAN IMPLANTED A TAXUS EXPRESS2 8.8% 3.00 X 32 MM DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE NON TORTUOUS, NON CALCIFIED, 90% STENOSED 3.0 MM DIAMETER MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) AND A VISION BARE METAL STENT IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. PLAVIX WAS ADMINISTERED PRE PROCEDURE AND HEPARIN AND A 2B/3A WERE GIVEN DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED ON CLOPIDOGREL AND ASPIRIN FOR 12 MONTHS. TWO MONTHS LATER, THE PT PRESENTED WITH COFFEE GRANULE VOMITING AND THEIR PLAVIX WAS STOPPED BUT THEY WERE CONTINUED ON ASPIRIN PER A PHYSICIAN WHO WAS NOT THEIR INTERVENTIONALIST. THIS PHYSICIAN WAS UNAWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CLOPIDOGREL AND ASPIRIN. THE PT DIED 8 DAYS LATER. THE POST MORTEM ESTABLISHED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS A THROMBOSIS IN THE DRUG ELUTING STENT. THE BARE METAL STENT WAS PATENT. THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT FEEL THE STENT WAS TO BLAME FOR THE DEATH. THE HOSP IS NOW PROVIDING A CARD FOR ALL DRUG ELUTING STENT PTS ADVISING THEM THAT THEY MUST NOT STOP THESE DRUGS (PLAVIX) WITHOUT FIRST REFERRING TO THE INTERVENTIONALIST MENTIONED ON THE CARD.
