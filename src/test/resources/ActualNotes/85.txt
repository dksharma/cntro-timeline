AT INDEX PROCEDURE AFTER PRE-DILATION, TWO OVERLAPPING CYPHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY AND A THIRD CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE DISTAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) AFTER PRE-DILATION. THE PT WAS A MALE WITH A REPORTED HISTORY OF ANGINA PECTORIS AND ABNORMAL LIPID METABOLISM. THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS AN ELECTIVE CASE IN WHICH TWO OVERLAPPING CYPHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY AND A THIRD CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE DISTAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) AFTER PRE-DILATION. TICLOPIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE 200 MG/DAY WAS INITIATED ON THE DAY OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND CONTINUED FOR 16 WEEKS. ASA 200 MG/DAY WAS INITIATED ON THE DAY OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND CONTINUED UNTIL THE REPORTED ADVERSE EVENT, APPROX THREE YRS LATER. HEPARIN 7,000 UNITS WAS GIVEN INTRA-PROCEDURALLY. ACT WAS NOT MEASURED. IT IS UNK IF ANTIPLATELET EFFECTIVENESS WAS MEASURED. THE MID LAD LESION WAS DE-NOVO, CALCIFIED AND A CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION (CTO). AHA/ACC CLASSIFICATION WAS TYPE C. THE LESION LENGTH WAS 35 MM WITH A VESSEL DIAMETER OF 2.5 MM. PREDILATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH A BALLOON (2.5/20 MM) AT 12 ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. FIRST CYPHER (2.5/23 MM) WAS IMPLANTED AT 22 ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. SECOND CYPHER (2.5/18 MM) WAS IMPLANTED AT 22 ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. THE TWO STENTS WERE OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER. POST-DILATATION WAS NOT CONDUCTED. IVUS WAS NOT CONDUCTED. THE RESIDUAL % OF STENOSIS WAS 0% TIMI FLOW BEFORE THE PROCEDURE WAS 0 AND 3 AFTER THE PROCEDURE. THE DISTAL RCA LESION WAS DE-NOVO AND ECCENTRIC WITH A VESSEL CALCIFICATION OF B2. THE LESION LENGTH WAS 15 MM AND VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 3.0 MM. PRE-DILATATION WAS NOT CONDUCTED. THIRD CYPHER (3.0/18) WAS IMPLANTED AT 20 ATM FOR 15 SECONDS. POST-DILATATION WAS NOT CONDUCTED. (IVUS) INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND WAS NOT CONDUCTED. THE RESIDUAL % OF STENOSIS WAS 0% TIMI FLOW BEFORE THE PROCEDURE WAS 1 AND 3 AFTER THE PROCEDURE. THREE YRS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSP DUE TO CHEST PAIN WITH ST SEGMENT ELEVATION CONFIRMED. IT WAS REPORTED HE WAS IN PRE-SHOCK CONDITION. CORONARY ARTERY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS CONDUCTED URGENTLY. THROMBOSIS WAS OBSERVED IN THE THREE CYPHER STENTS IMPLANTED AT INDEX PROCEDURE. TREATMENT INCLUDED ASPIRATION AND PLAIN OLD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (POBA) WITH PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY SUPPORT (PCPS) AND INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP). IT WAS REPORTED THAT CIRCULATION DYNAMICS WERE SUSTAINED BUT THERE WAS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE PT'S ANEMIA. THREE DAYS AFTER THIS EVENT, PCPS WAS DISCONTINUED DUE TO STABLE BLOOD PRESSURE. THE NEXT DAY THE PT'S BLOOD PRESSURE DRASTICALLY DECREASED, CPR WAS CONDUCTED, BUT HE PASSED AWAY. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS NOT DETERMINED AND THAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK POSSIBLY FROM RETROPERITONEAL HEMATOMA OR HEMORRHAGE FROM DIGESTIVE TRACT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK WAS NOT DUE TO THE CARDIAC PROCEDURE. AN AUTOPSY WAS NOT PERFORMED. THE STENTS REMAIN IMPLANTED. A REVIEW OF THE MFG DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVOLVED CYPHER LOTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. THE (DHR) DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW FOR THE DEVICE IS PENDING. THERE WERE NO ISSUES FOUND DURING THE MFG PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE REVIEW REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MFG AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. ADD'L INFO WAS REQUESTED AND REVIEWED FOR CORONARY STENT THROMBOSIS TO THE COATING SITE AND INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. NO NON-CONFORMANCES RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT WERE FOUND. VERY LATE THROMBOSIS WAS REPORTED AFTER IMPLANTATION OF THREE CYPHER STENTS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE CYPHERS WERE IMPLANTED AT GREATER THAN RATED BURST. THE USE OF PRESSURES HIGHER THAN THE RATED BURST PRESSURE (16 ATM) CAN RESULT IN INTIMAL DAMAGE AND/OR DISSECTION. STENT THROMBOSIS IS A KNOWN ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENTING. THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING STENT THROMBOSIS INCLUDING PT MEDICAL HISTORY, DIFFUSE DISEASE AND VESSEL AND LESION CHARACTERISTICS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT WAS ON TICLOPIDINE FOR 16 WEEKS POST STENT IMPLANTATION. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) CAUTIONS THAT THE PERIOD OF ANTIPLATELET ADMIN MUST BE PROLONGED OR SHORTENED APPROPRIATELY DEPENDING ON EACH PT'S CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, FOLLOW-UPS MUST BE CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION IS TERMINATED TO CONSIDER THE RESTART OF THE ANTIPLATELET ADMIN DEPENDING ON THE NECESSITY. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFO, THE PT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, LESION CHARACTERISTICS, PROCEDURAL FACTORS, AND POSSIBLE PHARMACOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED VERY LATE IN-STENT THROMBOSIS. THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE ANY ISSUES RELATED TO THE DESIGN OR MFR OF THE CORDIS PRODUCTS. THE DEVICE IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENTS DISTRIBUTED IN THE US. THIS IS ONE OF THREE DEVICES INVOLVED WITH THE REPORTED EVENT, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH MFG REPORT # 9616099-2008-02200 AND 9616099-2008-00201.
