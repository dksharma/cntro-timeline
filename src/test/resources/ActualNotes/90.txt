THIS FOREIGN CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENT IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENT. THIS IS ONE OF TWO PRODUCTS INVOLVED WITH THIS ADVERSE EVENT IN WHICH ASSOCIATED MANUFACTURER REPORT NUMBER IS 9616099-2008-02426. THIS MALE EXPERIENCED VERY LATE THROMBOSIS LEADING TO HIS DEATH POST IMPLANTATION OF TWO CYPHER FOREIGN STENTS. MEDICAL HISTORY LISTED ONLY DIABETES. DURING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE, TWO CYPHER STENTS (3.0/23MM AND 3.5/23MM) WERE IMPLANTED IN THE PT'S PROXIMAL LAD AND ONE 2.5/18MM CYPHER WAS IMPLANTED IN THE DISTAL CIRCUMFLEX. THE TARGET SITE IN THE LAD WAS DESCRIBED AS A TYPE C LESION: 40MM LESION LENGTH. CYPHER IS INDICATED FOR USE IN LESIONS UP TO 30MM. THE STENTS WERE IMPLANTED IN AN OVERLAPPING MANNER (PRESSURE UNK); THERE WAS NO RESIDUAL STENOSIS. THE TARGET SITE IN THE CIRCUMFLEX WAS 15MM LONG; THE STENT WAS IMPLANTED (PRESSURE UNK); THERE WAS NO RESIDUAL STENOSIS. NO COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED AND THE PT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASA AND TICLID. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW LONG THE MEDICATION WAS PRESCRIBED FOR OR IF THE PT WAS COMPLIANT WITH THE REGIMEN. APPROX 4 YEARS LATER, "THE PT BECAME UNCONSCIOUS WHILE DRINKING ALCOHOL DUE TO CARDIOGENIC SHOCK" AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL. ANGIOGRAPHY IDENTIFIED THROMBUS IN THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED LAD STENTS. TREATMENT INCLUDED ASPIRATION AND BALLOON DILATATION. NEW LESIONS IN THE RCA AND PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WERE ALSO FOUND. FOUR STENTS WERE IMPLANTED IN THE RCA BUT "THE PROCEDURE COULD NOT BE FINISHED IN TIME, AND THE PT PASSED AWAY DURING THE PROCEDURE". IT WAS THE PHYSICIAN'S OPINION THAT "THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS THE SYMPTOM OF DEHYDRATION DUE TO DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND THAT ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY WAS NOT CONDUCTED ACCORDINGLY. THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH WAS DETERIORATION OF HEART FUNCTION." THE STENTS COULD NOT BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS; THEY REMAINED IMPLANTED. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. STENT THROMBUS IS A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENTING; HOWEVER, THE TIME FRAME REPORTED COULD BE CONSIDERED OUT OF THE NORM. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE PT WAS STILL TAKING ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF IVUS WAS DONE AND THE RESULTS OF THE ANGIOGRAPHY DID NOT DISCUSS STENT APPOSITION TO THE VESSEL. WITH THE INFO THAT IS AVAILABLE, VESSEL/LESION CHARACTERISTICS (LONG LENGTH) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT.
