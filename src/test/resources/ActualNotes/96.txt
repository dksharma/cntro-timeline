"REPORTING STATUS: DEATH. REPORTING RATIONALE: DEATH. DEVICE ISSUE: NO DEVICE MALFUNCTION HAS BEEN REPORTED. IT WAS REPORTED VIA A TRIAL THAT IN 2008, A 3.0X18MM XIENCE V STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE MID LEFT ARTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD). ON THE FOLLOWING MONTH, A 2.75X18MM XIENCE V STENT WAS USED TO TREAT ANOTHER LESION IN THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). AFTER THE PCI OF THE RCA, THE PT DEVELOPED BLEEDING IN THE GROIN, SO ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL WERE STOPPED. ON THE NEXT DAY, THE PT BECAME HEMODYNAMIC INSTABLE. ON TWO DAYS LATER, THE PT COLLAPSED IN THE HOSPITAL DUE TO SUSPICION OF IN-STENT THROMBOSIS OF THE RCA AND ANGIOGRAM WAS DONE. THEREFORE, NEW PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) WAS PERFORMED IN THE RCA WITH NO IMPROVEMENT. FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED A MASSIVE LUNG EMBOLISM, SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PT DEVELOPED HYPOXIE, HYPOTENSION AND BRADYCARDIA AND DIED. NO ADDITIONAL EVENT OR PT INFO IS AVAILABLE.
SUMMATION-THROMBOSIS, HYPOTENSION AND DEATH ARE RISKS WITH CORONARY STENTING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BRADYCARDIA AND HYPOTENSION ARE SECONDARY EFFECTS OF THE LUNG EMBOLISM. THE IFU STATES, ""ANTIPLATELET DRUGS SHOULD BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH XIENCE V. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE PT IS COMPLIANT WITH THE POST PROCEDURAL ANTIPLATELET RECOMMENDATIONS. PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF PRESCRIBED ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION COULD RESULT IN A HIGHER RISK OF THROMBOSIS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR DEATH."" THE ANTIPLATELET THERAPY WAS STOPPED IN RESPONSE TO THE BLEEDING IN THE GROIN. A CONCLUSIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE EFFECTS AND RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEVICES CANNOT BE DETERMINED."
